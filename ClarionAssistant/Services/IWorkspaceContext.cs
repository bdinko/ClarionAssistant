    /// Classifying all 115 MCP tools showed 61 are not UI-bound, but 11 of those still
    /// reached into IDE-held state and so looked unmovable. Reading what they actually did
    /// showed the dependency is almost never IDE BEHAVIOUR — it is ambient session state
    /// that happens to hang off a WinForms control:
    ///
    ///     CurrentSolutionPath, RedFile, CurrentDbPath, CurrentVersionConfig,
    ///     ActiveRedFileService, BuildIndexLibraryPaths(), RunIndex()
    ///
    /// The build tools are the clearest case. build_solution / build_app / generate_source
    /// shell straight out to ClarionCL and MSBuild — genuinely editor-agnostic work — and
    /// their ENTIRE IDE dependency was one call, EditorService.GetOpenSolutionPath(), used
    /// as a FALLBACK when no path was supplied (McpToolRegistry.cs:1811, :2853).
    ///
    /// So this is not coupling to the IDE. It is coupling to "someone tells me the
    /// workspace". Ten of those eleven tools move behind this interface. Only
    /// get_ca_project_info is genuinely IDE-coupled (DataDictionary / ProjectService /
    /// SharpDevelop) and stays behind.
