    /// The live Clarion IDE text editor, as McpToolRegistry needs it (ticket d051fbd1).
    ///
    /// WHY THIS EXISTS. The registry has no IDE imports of its own — its usings are pure
    /// System.* plus SQLite and Web.Script.Serialization. Its ONLY hard compile blocker
    /// outside the addin was the concrete EditorService, which imports
    /// ICSharpCode.SharpDevelop.Gui, ICSharpCode.TextEditor and System.Windows.Forms.
    /// Depending on this interface instead is what lets the whole 4,500-line registry
    /// compile in the standalone MCP server.
    ///
    /// THIS INTERFACE IS NOT A PORTABILITY PROMISE. Every member here drives a live editor
    /// window. The standalone server does NOT implement it and must not pretend to: the
    /// tools that need it are simply not registered there. An implementation that returned
    /// plausible nulls would be worse than none, because an MCP client would advertise
    /// "get the active document" and silently get nothing.
    ///
    /// Scope: exactly the members McpToolRegistry uses, and nothing more. EditorService has
    /// a wider surface (including overloads taking a textArea object) which stays off the
    /// interface deliberately — a seam that mirrors the whole class is not a seam.
    ///
    /// The two STATIC members the registry also used — GetOpenSolutionPath and
    /// GetClarionInstallPath — are NOT here. They answer "which solution / where is Clarion",
    /// which is workspace context rather than editor manipulation, and both have meaningful
    /// non-IDE answers. They live on IWorkspaceContext.
