# End-to-end test for the standalone MCP server's stdio transport (ticket d051fbd1).
#
# WHY A SUBPROCESS AND NOT JUST --selftest-stdio. The in-process self-test drives the real
# read/dispatch/write loop, but over a StringReader/StringWriter. Three things that decide
# whether an MCP client can actually talk to this server exist ONLY when the process owns its
# own console, and are therefore invisible to it:
#
#   1. the stdout hijack (Console.SetOut -> stderr), which stops a stray Console.WriteLine
#      anywhere in ~4,500 lines of tool registry from injecting a non-JSON line;
#   2. the UTF-8-no-BOM encoding on the real stdout handle, where the Windows default is the
#      OEM code page;
#   3. clean exit on stdin EOF, which is how a client shuts the server down.
#
# Run:  powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File ClarionAssistant\tests\McpStdio.EndToEndTest.ps1
