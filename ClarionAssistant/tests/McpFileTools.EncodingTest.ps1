# End-to-end test: write_file / append_to_file must keep a Clarion source file in the encoding
# it already has (GH #203, ticket 90246460).
#
# THE BUG. Clarion source is traditionally Windows-ANSI (cp1252 on a Western machine) with no BOM.
# write_file re-encoded every .clw/.inc as UTF-8, so a Norwegian o-slash (one byte, F8) came back as
# two (C3 B8) - valid UTF-8, and mojibake ("A-tilde,cedilla") to the Clarion IDE and to every string literal the
# compiler bakes into the program. append_to_file was worse: it appended UTF-8 bytes onto a cp1252
# file, leaving one file in two encodings that no single decode can read.
#
# WHY THESE FIXTURES ARE RAW BYTES. Everything here is asserted at the byte level, and every
# fixture is written with WriteAllBytes. Two easier routes both hide the defect:
#   - a BOM'd fixture: every .NET / PowerShell reader honours a BOM, so the ANSI-read path under
#     test is never taken and the suite passes against the broken code;
#   - Set-Content / an encoding object: under PowerShell 7 "Default" is UTF-8, under 5.1 it is the
#     ANSI code page, so the same script seeds different bytes depending on who runs it.
# Non-ASCII in the requests is sent as JSON \u escapes for the same reason: the child's stdin is
# decoded in a console code page this script does not control.
#
# BOTH ENCODINGS ARE SEEDED. A suite with only cp1252 fixtures passes a fix that writes cp1252 to
# EVERYTHING - which would break every UTF-8 Clarion file instead.
#
# Run:  powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File ClarionAssistant\tests\McpFileTools.EncodingTest.ps1
