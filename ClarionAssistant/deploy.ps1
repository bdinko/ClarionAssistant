# versions register a "root" value under SoftVelocity\Clarion<key>) + known fallback paths
# (other dev machines) + drive-root glob scan. Returns EVERY existing install, deduped,
# registry hit first (the build binds against the first root's DLLs).
#
# Returning only the FIRST hit shipped a real incident (2026-08-13): the registry resolved
# Clarion 11 to C:\Clarion11, so the ALSO-LIVE C:\Clarion11-13372 silently kept a stale
# addin — the developer ran the old indexer for a day while every verification pass showed
# the new build "deployed and hash-verified" (in the four folders the script chose). A
# machine with two installs of one version must get the addin in BOTH.
#
# The drive-root glob scan is the slow part. It used to walk every mounted filesystem drive
# (network shares included) for every glob pattern, which turned every `-Version all` deploy
# into a full-machine scan per version before any output appeared. It still has to run even
# when registry+fallbacks already found a root: the 2026-08-13 incident's second install
# happened to be in Fallbacks, but the same shape at a path that ISN'T listed there is only
# caught by this scan. What the scan doesn't need is network shares, so it is restricted to
# fixed local drives — that keeps the speedup without losing any realistic coverage.
# Removable, optical and RAM drives are left out on purpose too (external USB hard disks

# --- Target must be idle (ticket 8aa391ba) ---
# Deploying over a live install produces a PARTIAL copy, and a partial copy is the dangerous
# outcome, not merely an annoying one: ClarionAssistant.dll is the first item copied and the least
# likely to be locked, so the one file anybody checks to confirm a deploy is exactly the file that
# lies. It happened twice, sessions apart, and cost a diagnosis both times.
#
# Checked BEFORE the build so a refusal costs seconds, not four MSBuild passes. -Kill is handled
# here too (moved up from just-before-the-deploy-loop) so "make the target idle" is one step rather
# than two, and so the build does not run against a target we are about to refuse.
function Get-DeployBlockers {

      Anything holding files inside an addin folder WE ARE ABOUT TO WRITE. Scoped to $Roots on
      purpose: a Clarion 12 IDE does not lock Clarion 11.1's addin folder, and a gate that refuses
      safe work teaches people to pass -AllowRunning reflexively, which is the same as having no
      gate. Only report what would actually collide.

      Two categories, because a name list alone misses the ones that matter:
        - Clarion.exe: lives in <root>\bin\ but LOADS the addin, locking ClarionAssistant.dll.
        - ANY process whose own image sits under <root>\accessory\addins\ClarionAssistant\ - that
          is clarion-mcp-server.exe, clarion-indexer.exe and the bundled lsp-server\node.exe. These
          run with Clarion CLOSED (an external MCP client starts one), which is precisely how a
          deploy with the IDE shut down still comes out half-written. That happened today.

      Path access throws for processes we cannot open; those are skipped rather than guessed at.
      A process we cannot see is a gap in this check, not a clean result - which is why the copy
      loop still reports FAIL per file and the run still exits non-zero on a partial.
