# lies. It happened twice, sessions apart, and cost a diagnosis both times.
#
# Checked BEFORE the build so a refusal costs seconds, not four MSBuild passes. -Kill is handled

      Anything holding files inside an addin folder WE ARE ABOUT TO WRITE. Scoped to $Roots on
      purpose: a Clarion 12 IDE does not lock Clarion 11.1's addin folder, and a gate that refuses
      safe work teaches people to pass -AllowRunning reflexively, which is the same as having no
      gate. Only report what would actually collide.

      Two categories, because a name list alone misses the ones that matter:
        - Clarion.exe: lives in <root>\bin\ but LOADS the addin, locking ClarionAssistant.dll.
        - ANY process whose own image sits under <root>\accessory\addins\ClarionAssistant\ - that
          is clarion-mcp-server.exe, clarion-indexer.exe and the bundled lsp-server\node.exe. These
          run with Clarion CLOSED (an external MCP client starts one), which is precisely how a
          deploy with the IDE shut down still comes out half-written. That happened today.

      Path access throws for processes we cannot open; those are skipped rather than guessed at.
      A process we cannot see is a gap in this check, not a clean result - which is why the copy
      loop still reports FAIL per file and the run still exits non-zero on a partial.
