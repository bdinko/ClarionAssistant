# Check-PromptSync.ps1
# Guards the embedded assistant's system prompt against the drift that shipped in 5.7.
#
# THE SETUP. Two files hold the same document:
#   Terminal\clarion-assistant-prompt.md   the BUNDLED prompt - what the installer ships
#   .claude\CLAUDE.md                      what the assistant actually reads at runtime
#
# AssistantChatControl.DeployClaudeMd() copies the first over the second on EVERY terminal
# spin-up ("Always overwrite - the dynamic context from last session needs to be cleared").
# That is correct behaviour and is not what broke. (Since GH #227 it only overwrites a copy that
# opens with the prompt's own first lines - Services\ClaudeMdDeployer.Signature - so keep those.)
#
# WHAT BROKE. In this repo the destination is also a TRACKED file, and it is the copy people
# naturally edit - it is the one loaded as project instructions when you work here. So doc
# improvements landed on .claude\CLAUDE.md, the overwrite silently discarded them from disk,
# and the bundled prompt - the artifact users receive - never moved:
#
#   .claude\CLAUDE.md                      last touched 2026-08-05  311 lines
#   Terminal\clarion-assistant-prompt.md   last touched 2026-07-30  240 lines
#
# Six days apart, and among the casualties was the 51-tool audit that 5.7's release notes
# announced as "Registry and documentation are now at parity". True of the repo copy; not
# true of the artifact. Every user's assistant ran without ~50 of its own tools documented,
# and the tools worked fine when called - only the doc hid them. Confirmed live 2026-08-08:
# the deployed prompt in C:\Clarion12 was byte-identical to the Jul 30 one.
#
# WHY A CHECK RATHER THAN A CODE CHANGE. Keep the files identical and the overwrite becomes a
# no-op: nothing is lost, and the working tree stops showing a phantom modification. The only
# thing that has to hold is that they never diverge - which is precisely what nothing was
# checking. Same reasoning as Check-ReleaseDocs.ps1: the failure was silent, so make it loud.
#
# Usage:
#   .\Check-PromptSync.ps1            # exit 0 in sync, 1 drifted
#   .\Check-PromptSync.ps1 -Fix       # copy the runtime doc over the bundled prompt
#
# Line endings are normalised before comparing: git converts on checkout, so a CRLF/LF
# mismatch is an artifact of how a file was written, not real drift.
