.SYNOPSIS
    Re-pin the bundled Clarion LSP server to a tagged release of msarson/Clarion-Extension
    and rebuild it with our CodeGraph overlay, instead of hand-maintaining a drifting snapshot.
    GitHub #40 (LSP snapshot drift).

.DESCRIPTION
    The bundled LSP server that deploy.ps1 copies out of $CLARIONLSP_ROOT is a build artifact
    of the public Clarion VS Code extension (msarson/Clarion-Extension) with our CodeGraph
    integration applied on top. Because that snapshot is hand-maintained it drifts from upstream.

    This script turns the pin into a repeatable, git-anchored operation:

      1. Fetch tags from origin (msarson/Clarion-Extension).
      2. Report the drift between the currently checked-out commit and the target tag.
      3. (with -Apply) Re-pin to the target tag, re-apply the server.ts CodeGraph wiring,
         rebuild out/, and verify the CodeGraph markers survived the rebuild.

    KEY FACT that makes this safe: the CodeGraph overlay source files
    (server/src/codegraph-bridge.ts, codegraph-indexer.ts) are UNTRACKED in the upstream
    clone and out/ is gitignored, so `git checkout <tag>` leaves them in place. The ONLY
    tracked artifact that needs re-application is the wiring inside server/src/server.ts.

    Without -Apply the script is READ-ONLY (fetch + report only).

.PARAMETER LspRoot
    The upstream clone (a git checkout of msarson/Clarion-Extension with our overlay).
    Defaults to $env:CLARIONLSP_ROOT, else H:\DevLaptop\ClarionLSP (legacy dev path).
    ONLY used by the legacy overlay path (-Apply). -Pure ignores it entirely and clones
    source.repo itself, so a contributor with no such clone can still build the pinned server.

.PARAMETER Tag
    Target release tag to pin to. Defaults to targetPin.tag from lsp-snapshot.json.

.PARAMETER Apply
    Actually perform the checkout/rebuild. Omit for a dry run (fetch + drift report only).

.PARAMETER SkipBuild
    Skip `npm ci && npm run compile` after checkout (report + re-pin only).

.PARAMETER Pure
    #40 disposition (2026-07-03): build STOCK upstream at the tag with NO CodeGraph overlay. The overlay
    is retired — CodeGraph go-to-def / references / completion are served C#-side (SharedLspBridge +
    CodeGraphProvider), so the bundled LSP is pure msarson/Clarion-Extension. Produces a clean tag build
    under $PureRoot (default <repo>\.lsp-build\<Tag>) which deploy.ps1 sources instead of the overlay clone.
    Independent of -Apply (which is the legacy overlay-keeping path). Idempotent: skips the rebuild if a
    pure build is already present. VERIFIES the built server.js contains ZERO codegraph refs.
    Requires NOTHING but git + npm + network: the tree is cloned from source.repo at $Tag.

.PARAMETER PureRoot
    Where the pure build lives / is created. Defaults to <repo>\.lsp-build\<Tag>.

.PARAMETER TrustNonGitTree
    -Pure only. Allow `npm ci` / `npm run compile` in a $PureRoot that is NOT a git checkout. Such a
    tree's origin and commit cannot be verified, and npm runs its package scripts, so by default -Pure
    refuses to build one. An existing, stamped build there is still hashed and recorded without it.

.EXAMPLE
    # Dry run — show how far the bundled server has drifted from v0.9.6
    .\Sync-LspServer.ps1

.EXAMPLE
    # Re-pin to v0.9.6 and rebuild WITH the CodeGraph overlay (legacy path)
    .\Sync-LspServer.ps1 -Apply

.EXAMPLE
    # Build PURE upstream v0.9.6 (no overlay) for the #40 default bundled server
    .\Sync-LspServer.ps1 -Pure -Tag v0.9.6
