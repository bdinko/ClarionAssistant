.SYNOPSIS
    Fails if any file we write can be given a UTF-8 byte-order mark.

.DESCRIPTION
    THE MEASUREMENT THIS GUARD RESTS ON (2026-09-10, CLR 4.0.30319, every probe paired with a
    control that fired, so a PASS means something):

        File.WriteAllText(p, s, Encoding.UTF8)        -> ef bb bf 61 ...   BOM
        File.WriteAllText(p, s, new UTF8Encoding($false)) -> 61 ...        no BOM
        File.WriteAllText(p, s)            [2-arg]    -> 61 ...            no BOM
        File.ReadAllText(p, Encoding.UTF8)           -> strips it (first char U+007B, len 7 not 8)
        File.ReadAllLines(p)                         -> strips it
        fetch().then(r => r.text())                  -> strips it (control: ignoreBOM:true kept U+FEFF)
        node readFileSync + JSON.parse               -> DOES NOT. The only reader that breaks.
        the Clarion compiler                         -> does not

    THE ARGUMENT IS THE DEFECT, NOT A MISSING ONE. `System.Text.Encoding.UTF8` emits a preamble;
    the overload default does not. So the wrong spelling is the one that LOOKS like a
    clarification, which is how ticket 9b9dbc7d shipped: we wrote .claude\settings.local.json with
    a BOM, node's JSON.parse rejected the file, Claude Code ignored it silently, and the status
    line never worked for anyone.

    BUT DO NOT "FIX" IT BY DELETING THE ARGUMENT. That was this ticket's first instinct and it is
    subtly wrong. Measured, with a lone surrogate as input:
        File.WriteAllText(p, s)                      -> THREW
        File.WriteAllText(p, s, Encoding.UTF8)       -> ef bb bf 61 ef bf bd 62
        File.WriteAllText(p, s, new UTF8Encoding($false)) ->        61 ef bf bd 62
    The 2-arg overload is UTF8Encoding(false, throwOnInvalidBytes: TRUE). Dropping the argument
    therefore removes the BOM *and* flips invalid input from "write U+FFFD" to "throw" - and at a
    site whose write sits in a try/catch that only logs, that turns malformed text into a silently
    stale file. Same failure class as the bug we were fixing.
    `EncodingHelper.Utf8NoBom` is UTF8Encoding(false, false): byte-identical to Encoding.UTF8
    minus the preamble, and nothing else. That is the correct substitution, and it is what all
    14 triaged sites now use.

    RULE 1 - the curated list: files a non-.NET parser opens. Fails on a BOM-emitting encoding,
             and ALSO fails if the write MOVES, because a guard that can no longer see its target
             keeps reporting PASS. Warns (does not fail) if a guarded site drops to the implicit
             2-arg form, per the paragraph above.
    RULE 2 - repo-wide and categorical: no write API anywhere may be handed a BOM-emitting
             encoding. Rule 1 protects the known readers; Rule 2 protects the reader nobody has
             written yet. Rule 1's BOM check is deliberately belt-and-braces behind Rule 2, which
             is the stronger of the two; Rule 1's unique value is marker-gone detection.

    HOW RULE 2 READS C#, AND WHY IT IS NOT A REGEX. The first cut was regex over comment-stripped
    text, and review took it apart four times running, every time with ordinary compiling C#: a
    `//` inside a string, three-deep parens, an interpolation hole holding a quote, and a verbatim
    string inside a hole. Each was scanned and passed while the file count went UP, so the miss was
    always the pattern, never the walk - and the last one blanked the REST OF THE FILE, reporting
    every write below it clean. The per-shape history now lives in the $fixtures list below, which
    is the canonical catalogue: each entry carries the shape and what it defeated.
    So Rule 2 LEXES. Split-Code blanks every non-code character - line and block comments, strings,
    verbatim strings, char literals, and interpolated strings including their holes - while
    preserving offsets so line numbers stay exact; Get-CallArguments then walks real balanced
    parens. Nesting is unbounded, and a `//`, quote or paren inside any literal is inert.

    WHAT IT STILL CANNOT SEE, stated rather than left to be discovered:
      - Indirection. `var enc = Encoding.UTF8; File.WriteAllText(p, s, enc);` is green, and MUST
        stay green - ModernEmbeditorViewContent's .clw save passes a detected `_fileEncoding` this
        way on purpose. No non-dataflow scanner can separate those two cases.
      - A write API this list does not name.
      - A C# 11 raw string, which is over-blanked rather than modelled (see Split-Code).

    PROVE IT RATHER THAN TRUST IT:  .\Check-BomFreeWrites.ps1 -SelfTest
    Asserts the scanner goes red on every evasion shape review has found, and green on every
    look-alike. It builds its fixtures in memory and touches no file. A guard nobody has watched
    fail is not evidence - and four times now, the thing that was wrong was the guard.

    AND PROVE THE FIXTURES THEMSELVES. A green self-test only means something if a broken scanner
    would turn it red, so the set is MUTATION-TESTED: break one branch of Split-Code, re-run
    -SelfTest, and confirm it fails. That check found three branches pinned by nothing - the vstr
    body blank, the newline containment guards, and the {{ escape - which were exactly the
    statements hand-inlined for the speed fix, so the untested branches and the hand-edited ones
    were the same branches. The BRANCH COVERAGE fixtures below close that, each verified to fail
    under exactly one mutation (each reports "1 of N", so no fixture is masking another).
    It also corrected one of them: the obvious two-line form of the {{ fixture pinned NOTHING,
    because the hole's newline guard contained the damage; only a same-line write is swallowed.

    AND THE FIXTURE SET DECAYS, which is the part worth remembering. Adding that same newline guard
    silently disarmed two fixtures that HAD been pinning real branches, because their damage was on
    the next line and the guard now contained it. The guard and the fixture were measuring the same
    thing, so the fixtures stopped discriminating the moment the guard landed, and nothing failed.
    That is why the sweep is a script and not advice:
        .\Check-BomFreeWrites.Mutations.ps1
    Run it after ANY change to Split-Code, Get-CallArguments, the regex constants, or the fixture
    list. Expect every branch CAUGHT and "ALL BRANCHES PINNED". A SKIPPED row means the harness
    lost track of a branch - that is a harness failure, not a pass.

.PARAMETER SelfTest
    Verify the scanner against known-bad and known-good fixtures, then exit. Touches no repo file.

.NOTES
    Windows PowerShell 5.1 compatible, and must stay that way. Pure ASCII, no BOM.
    Exit 0 = clean. Exit 1 = at least one write can emit a BOM.

      literals and comments cannot contribute tokens, while every offset - and therefore every
      line number - stays exactly where it was. Newlines are preserved for the same reason.

      A STACK, NOT NESTED LOOPS. The first lexer handled an interpolation hole with an inner loop
      that re-implemented string scanning, and that copy did not know about @"verbatim" strings.
      So `$"{p.TrimEnd(@"\")}"` - ordinary Windows C# - had its backslash read as an escape, which
      ate the closing quote, lost quote parity, and (with no newline guard on that branch) blanked
      THE REST OF THE FILE. Every write below it was reported clean. One context stack removes the
      whole class: a hole is just code again, so any literal legal at top level is legal inside it,
      to any depth, and each literal kind is spelled out exactly once.

      Contexts: code | str | vstr | char | interp(verbatim) | hole
        - code   : real source. Nothing is blanked. Opening a literal pushes.
        - hole   : the {...} of an interpolated string. Behaves like code - and IS blanked, because
                   it lives inside a literal - and `}` at its own brace depth 0 pops back to interp.
        - str    : "..."   \ escapes; an unterminated one stops at the newline rather than
                   swallowing the file.
        - vstr   : @"..."  "" escapes, \ is NOT an escape, newlines are legal.
        - char   : '...'   \ escapes, newline-guarded like str.
        - interp : the literal text of $"..." / $@"..." / @$"...". {{ and }} are escapes, { pushes
                   a hole, and a non-verbatim one is newline-guarded.

      KNOWN LIMIT: a C# 11 raw string ("""...""") is lexed as a run of empty/short strings rather
      than modelled properly. That over-blanks rather than under-blanks - parity is preserved and
      the fixture for it trips - but it is not a faithful reading.
