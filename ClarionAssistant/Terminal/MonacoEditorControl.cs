    // ── Monaco-default-editor converge (task cc8b092f), STEPS 1–2 ───────────────────────────────
    // Goal (John/Mark): ONE Monaco protocol host shared by BOTH the standalone file-mode embeditor
    // view (ModernEmbeditorViewContent) AND the dual-control source overlay (MonacoClarionEditor),
    // instead of three separate WebView2/Monaco paths.
    //
    // STEP 1 (done): WebView2 lifecycle + nav + the JS<->C# transport skeleton.
    // STEP 2 (this revision): port the inbound action DISPATCH and the transport-pure outbound
    //   senders into the control; expand IMonacoEditorHost to the full typed callback surface.
    //   The state-assembling senders (SendSource / ApplyHistory / ApplySettings) stay host-side
    //   because they read host fields + domain types; the host builds their JSON and calls PostJson.
    //
    // STILL ZERO-IMPACT: nothing references this control yet, so ModernEmbeditorViewContent is
    // byte-for-byte unchanged. The dispatch + senders are COPIED (not cut) faithfully from the view
    // so STEP 3's rewire is a mechanical swap.
