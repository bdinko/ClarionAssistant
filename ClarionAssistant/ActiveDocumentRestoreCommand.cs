    /// /Workspace/Autostart command — remembers which document tab was ACTIVE when a solution closed and
    /// re-selects it when the solution is opened again.
    ///
    /// The IDE persists only the LIST of open files (preferences\*.cwproj.*.xml, array "files", in tab
    /// order) — there is no active-document entry anywhere. On reopen it opens that list in order, so the
    /// last file in the list always ends up active, whatever the developer was looking at. This class
    /// supplies the missing piece:
    ///
    ///   record  — the file whose tab is DISPLAYED is written to active-documents.txt (one line per solution).
    ///             The IDE's own ActiveWorkbenchWindowChanged is not used for files that have a CA Editor: it only
    ///             fires once a document takes keyboard focus, so a plain tab click can leave it (and
    ///             ActiveWorkbenchWindow) on the previously focused tab for as long as focus stays elsewhere.
    ///             Each CA Editor reports its own tab through NotifyTabShown; the window event still covers
    ///             other document types (.app, dictionary, ...).
    ///   freeze  — every close path (Close Solution, opening another solution, IDE exit) calls
    ///             SaveSolutionPreferences FIRST and only then closes the tabs one by one, each close revealing
    ///             another tab, and raises SolutionClosing only after that. So recording is frozen at
    ///             SolutionPreferencesSaving — the same moment the IDE saves its own file list.
    ///             SolutionClosing/SolutionClosed freeze too, as a backstop. A cancelled close (Cancel on a
    ///             save prompt) leaves the solution open, and recording resumes.
    ///   restore — the IDE reopens the saved file list in ONE synchronous UI-thread call
    ///             (ProjectService.ParserServiceCreatedProjectContents, a plain FileService.OpenFile loop posted
    ///             by the parser's loadSolutionProjects thread after SolutionLoaded). It raises nothing when it
    ///             finishes, but a message posted to the UI thread from inside that loop only runs after the loop
    ///             returns. So a ViewOpened of the restore posts the selection, which lands right after
    ///             the last file has opened. The post waits until the saved file itself is open: a view that
    ///             opens BEFORE the loop (the .app tab when the solution comes from Recent Applications, a
    ///             start page) is not the loop. A verify pass 2 s later re-selects once if something selected
    ///             another tab; if the post is somehow delivered early, any later ViewOpened pushes that verify
    ///             back, and a quiet-window check (no view opened for 2.5 s) is the fallback if it never runs.
    ///             Recording resumes when the restore ends. Only the quiet window and the caps give up, and a
    ///             give-up HOLDS recording until the developer's own next tab change, so a reopen loop that
    ///             arrives late never records its last file over the saved choice (and if it opens the saved
    ///             file within the cap, that file is still selected).
