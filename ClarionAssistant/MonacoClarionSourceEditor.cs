    //   editor race ahead of stock ClarionWinEditor, and the Structure Designer (Ctrl+D) still
    //   works through the subclass (both designer gates are is-a checks ClarionEditor satisfies).
    // PHASE 1 (this file, in progress): host a Monaco/WebView2 overlay over the live editor.
    //   FOUNDATION landed here = capture the live text area from our subclass + prove we can read
    //   its document + a persisted toggle so the overlay can be flipped on per-file without a
    //   rebuild. The actual WebView2 attach + caret/document sync is wired in the live test loop
    //   (it's the freeze-prone part — native ops during WebView2 focus — and needs in-IDE
    //   iteration; see [[project_modern_embeditor]] FREEZE fix). Overlay is OFF by default.
