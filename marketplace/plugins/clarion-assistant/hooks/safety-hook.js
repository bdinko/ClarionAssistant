 * Intercepts Bash, Read, Write, Edit, and MCP SQL tool calls to block

 * Matchers registered in settings.local.json:
 *   - Bash                                    (shell commands)
 *   - Read                                    (file reads)
 *   - Write|Edit                              (file writes)
 *   - mcp__sqlite__write_query|mcp__mssql__query  (SQL execution)
 *
 * Decision outcomes:
 *   - DENY:  Blocked outright, agent gets rejection reason.
 *   - ASK:   User prompted for approval before execution.
 *   - ALLOW: No output, exit 0 (fast path).
 *
 * Performance: Pure pattern matching, no HTTP or disk I/O. Target < 50ms.

// ── Process-kill detection (ticket 24a72aa1) ────────────────────────
//
// The kill rule used to ask whenever a kill word appeared anywhere in the
// command, so
//   grep -n '"quit"\|"kill"' *.cs
// stopped a helper on a confirmation prompt until the Owner answered it — a
// hook's "ask" overrides bypass mode.
//
// It still asks for a kill word anywhere, except inside a SIMPLE quoted
// string: '...' or "..." that opens and closes on one line, where "..." holds
// no $(, ${ or backtick (bash would run or expand those). Everything else is
// left as it is. In particular this hook does not try to understand heredocs,
// comments, ${...} or $'...': five review passes found that each attempt to
// interpret them hid a real kill somewhere, while leaving them alone only
// costs an extra prompt.
//
// FAIL SAFE: at the first quote that is not simple — unclosed, spanning a
// line, $'...', or a "..." holding $( ${ ` — reading stops and the rest of
// the command stays as it is. A misread therefore makes the rule ask, never
// stay silent.
//
// A simple quoted string that IS a kill program is not data, because bash runs
// it: a path or .exe name ending in a kill word ("C:/Windows/System32/
// taskkill.exe", "/usr/bin/kill") wherever it stands — quoting a full path is
// ordinary on Windows — and the bare word ('kill') where a command starts
// (see atCommandStart). So is a quoted script or program whose file name holds
// a kill word anywhere ("./scripts/kill.sh", "C:/My Tools/kill-server.bat";
// see isKillScript). The price: such a path asks even as an argument
// (rg "taskkill.exe", ls "C:/tools/kill.exe", cat "kill.sh").
// grep "kill" x stays silent: there the word is an argument.
//
// Quoted text also counts when the command runs a variable as a command
// (CMD="taskkill //F //IM x.exe"; $CMD), because the kill is stored in quotes
// and run from the variable.
//
// If the command also runs a program that executes code (a shell,
// PowerShell, a language runtime, awk, trap, watch, ssh, eval, ...), quoted
// text counts too: bash -c "kill 1" and node -e "process.kill(1)" ask. That
// check reads the command as written, quotes and all, so a quoted path such as
// "/c/Program Files/Git/bin/bash.exe" is still seen.
//
// Accepted: an unquoted mention (grep -n kill *.cs) still asks, as before, and
// so does a quoted one in a command that also names a runner (echo 'use sh to
// kill it'). A kill inside quotes run by a program not listed below is not
// seen; this guards against accidents, not evasion.

// command starts:

// then else elif); or after any of those followed only by VAR=val words and
// redirections written against their target (X=1 'kill', >/dev/null 'kill',
// 2>/dev/null 'kill'). It walks back one word at a time and stops at the first
// word that is none of these.
//
// Accepted: a redirection with a space before its target (> /dev/null 'kill',
// < in 'kill') or one ending in &N (2>&1 'kill') is not skipped, so a quoted
// bare kill after it is read as an argument and does not ask. Nobody writes a
// kill that way by accident.
//
// `text` is an array of single characters, not a string: reading one character
// of a string built with += makes V8 copy the whole string first, so indexing
// it once per quote was quadratic on its own (80000 quotes took 8 s).
// `seen` maps a position in `text` to the answer for the text before it. The
// caller only ever appends to `text`, so an answer never goes stale, and every
// position is walked once per command: without it, X='kill' repeated walks
// back over all the earlier ones each time, which is quadratic too.
// `seen` only holds word boundaries, so it cannot help quotes glued into one
// word ('kill''kill'..., ,"kill","kill"...): each would rescan the whole word.
// A word longer than MAX_WORD therefore counts as a command start, so a quoted
// bare kill word after it is kept and the command asks; other quoted text is
// unaffected. Nobody glues 256 characters to a quoted kill word by hand.
