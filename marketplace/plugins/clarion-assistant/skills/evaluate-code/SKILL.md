# Evaluate Code

Interactive skill for evaluating Clarion application code. Guides the developer through analysis, review, and optional code improvements applied through the embeditor.

## Trigger

- `/evaluate-code` command
- "Evaluate Code" button on the Home page

## Workflow

### Phase 1: Scope

Ask the developer what they want to evaluate:

> **What would you like to evaluate?**
> 1. **Entire application** — all procedures in the open app
> 2. **Specific procedure** — name a procedure to focus on
> 3. **Embeditor code** — evaluate what's currently open in the embeditor
> 4. **Text editor file** — evaluate the file currently open in the text editor
> 5. **Selected code** — evaluate only the currently selected text

Wait for the developer's response before proceeding.

### Phase 2: Gather Code

Depending on the scope chosen:

**Option 1 (Entire app) or Option 2 (Specific procedure):**
1. Use `get_app_info` to get the app name and file path
2. Determine the TXA output path: same directory as the .app file, named `{AppName}_evaluate.txa`
3. Use `export_txa` to export:
   - If evaluating the entire app: export without specifying procedures
   - If evaluating a specific procedure: export with that procedure name (and its parent if it's a local procedure)
4. Confirm the export completed

**Option 3 (Embeditor code):**
1. Use `get_embed_info` to check if an embeditor is open and get context (procedure name, embed point)
2. Use `get_active_file` to read the current embed content
3. If no embeditor is open, tell the developer and ask them to open one first

**Option 4 (Text editor file):**
1. Use `get_active_file` first — this returns the focused text editor content
2. If the result is a source file (.clw, .inc, .equ, .int, .trn), use it directly
3. If the result is a .app or .dct file (not a text source), fall back: use `get_open_files` to list all open tabs, filter to text source files, and ask the developer which one to evaluate
4. If NO text source files are found anywhere, tell the developer: "No text source files are open. Please open a .clw or .inc file first, or choose a different scope."
5. If it's a .clw or .inc file, also use `analyze_class` for deeper class-level analysis

**Option 5 (Selected code):**
1. Use `get_selected_text` to get the currently selected text
2. If no text is selected or the result is empty, tell the developer and ask them to select some code first
3. Use `get_active_file` to get the file context (path, language) — if this returns a .app file, still use the selected text as-is (the selection might be from a different panel)
4. Use `get_cursor_position` to know where in the file the selection is

### Phase 3: Analyze

Read and analyze the code based on scope:

1. For options 1-2: **Read the TXA** to understand embed structure, procedure relationships, and template context, then **read the source files** (.clw/.inc) using `read_file`
2. For options 3-5: analyze the gathered code directly
3. For class-based code, use `analyze_class` and `sync_check` for deeper analysis

Evaluate for:
- **Bugs**: Logic errors, off-by-one, null/empty checks, resource leaks
- **Performance**: Unnecessary loops, repeated file access, missing indexes, N+1 patterns
- **Clarity**: Confusing variable names, overly complex logic, dead code
- **Clarion idioms**: Proper use of QUEUE operations, FILE handling, string functions, GROUP overlays
- **Thread safety**: THREAD variables, shared file access patterns
- **Error handling**: Missing error checks after file operations, ERRORCODE() usage

Present findings organized by severity:
- **BLOCKER** - Will cause crashes, data corruption, or wrong results
- **WARNING** - Likely problems or significant inefficiencies
- **SUGGESTION** - Improvements for readability, maintainability, or performance
- **INFO** - Observations, not necessarily problems

### Phase 4: Improve (if requested)

If the developer asks you to fix or improve any findings:

1. **Make a working copy** of the code being changed. Save it alongside the original with a descriptive suffix (e.g., `ProcedureName_optimized.clw`)
2. **Apply your changes** to the working copy
3. **ALWAYS show the diff** using `show_diff` with:
   - `original_file` pointing to the original source
   - `modified_file` pointing to your working copy
   - `ignore_whitespace` set to `true`
   - Descriptive `title` (e.g., "CreateTheClass - Performance Optimization")
4. Wait for the developer to review the diff. They may add notes via the diff viewer.
5. Use `get_diff_result` to check if they approved, submitted notes, or cancelled.

### Phase 5: Apply via Embeditor

After the developer approves changes (or you've addressed their review notes):

1. **Ask** the developer if they want to apply the changes to the app:
   > Would you like me to apply these changes to the app via the embeditor?
2. If yes:
   - Use the TXA (from Phase 2) to identify which embed points contain the code being changed
   - Parse the TXA to find the exact embed location: procedure name, embed point (e.g., `EMBED %ProcedureRoutines`), and any parent procedure
   - Use `open_procedure_embed` to open the embeditor for the target procedure
   - Use `get_embed_info` to confirm you're in the right embed
   - Navigate embeds with `next_embed`/`prev_embed` or `next_filled_embed`/`prev_filled_embed` to reach the correct embed point
   - Apply the changes using the editor operations (`replace_range`, `replace_text`, etc.)
   - Use `save_and_close_embeditor` to save
3. Confirm the changes were applied successfully

## Critical Rules

1. **For app/procedure scope, ALWAYS export a fresh TXA** at the start. Never rely on a stale export. For embeditor/editor/selection scopes, read from the IDE directly.
2. **ALWAYS show a diff** before applying any code changes. The developer must see what's changing.
3. **NEVER apply changes to the embeditor without asking first.** The developer decides.
4. **Use `ignore_whitespace: true`** in all diff views to avoid noisy whitespace-only differences.
5. **Keep the working copy files** so the developer has a reference. Don't delete them.
6. **If the developer has review notes**, address them and show a new diff before applying.
7. **One procedure at a time** when applying via embeditor. Don't try to batch multiple procedures.

## TXA Embed Structure Reference

In a TXA file, embeds are **not indented**, and the code sits in a `[SOURCE]` block with a priority. A procedure's embeds are all listed under one `[EMBED]` header, which closes with a single `[END]` after the last entry. Shape for a procedure with a window-method embed followed by a global one:
```
[EMBED]
EMBED %WindowManagerMethodCodeSection
[INSTANCES]
WHEN 'Init'
[INSTANCES]
WHEN '(),BYTE'
[DEFINITION]
[SOURCE]
PROPERTY:BEGIN
PRIORITY 8500
PROPERTY:END
  ! Actual embed code here
[END]
[END]
[END]
EMBED %ProcedureRoutines
[DEFINITION]
[SOURCE]
PROPERTY:BEGIN
PRIORITY 4000
PROPERTY:END
  ! Global embed code here
[END]
[END]
```
Every `[DEFINITION]` and every `[INSTANCES]` closes with its own `[END]`, so an entry ends with one `[END]` plus one per context level: 1 for a global embed, 3 for a window method or control event, 4 for a browse method. Sibling `WHEN`s (other instances of the same embed point) share their level's `[INSTANCES]` and follow the previous `[DEFINITION]`'s `[END]` directly. The final `[END]` above closes `[EMBED]` — when adding an embed to a procedure that already has some, insert the new `EMBED` entry inside the existing `[EMBED]` block rather than adding another `[END]`. When unsure, hand-build the embed in the IDE, export the TXA, and copy that shape.

Local procedures appear nested under their parent procedure. To find which embed contains specific code, search the TXA for the code text and look at the surrounding EMBED structure.

## Important

NEVER fabricate findings or use placeholder data. ALWAYS use the MCP tools to read real code from the IDE before producing any evaluation. If a tool call fails, tell the developer — do not make up results.
