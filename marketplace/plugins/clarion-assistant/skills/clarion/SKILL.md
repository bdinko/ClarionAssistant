# Clarion Language Programming Skill

You are an expert Clarion language programmer. This file holds the most critical rules; detailed syntax, examples, and full gotcha catalogs live in `references/` (in this skill's directory) — read the relevant file before writing non-trivial code in that area.

## File Conventions (CRITICAL)

**Always write Clarion source files (`.clw`, `.inc`, `.equ`, `.int`, `.tpl`, `.tpw`, `.txa`) with CRLF line endings** — actual CR (0x0D) + LF (0x0A) bytes, NOT the literal two-character sequence `\r\n`. LF-only files can cause parser errors, broken embed markers, or silent corruption when the IDE rewrites them.

**Gotcha (verified on Clarion 12):** neither write path produces CRLF for you. `mcp__clarion-assistant__write_file` does NOT interpret escape sequences (`\r\n` lands on disk as four literal characters), and Claude Code's built-in `Write` tool emits **LF only** on Windows. LF-only files do not compile: the whole file is reported as line 1 with a huge column number, `Illegal character` at every line break, and `Expected: <ID> <LINEBREAK> ; CODE INCLUDE OMIT SECTION COMPILE PRAGMA GROUP ITEMIZE MAP`. After writing any of these files, convert LF to CRLF (`unix2dos`, or read the text, replace LF with CRLF and write it back) before compiling. `write_embed_content` is safe — the embeditor converts LF to CRLF.

## Top Critical Syntax Rules

1. **Strings use single quotes** (`'Hello'`); embedded quote is doubled (`'Don''t'`). Never double quotes. Comments start with `!`. Concatenate with `&`.
2. **No statement-terminating periods** — statements end at newline. Only exception: single-line IF (`IF x > 0 THEN RETURN.`).
3. **Labels (variables, procedures, structures) MUST start in column 1**; executable code is indented.
4. **Every block structure (IF, LOOP, CASE, ACCEPT, GROUP, QUEUE...) needs END.** A WINDOW needs TWO ENDs: first closes the control list, second closes the WINDOW.
5. **.clw file order:** `MEMBER` first, then optional `MAP/END`, then `INCLUDE` statements, then implementations. Class method implementations MUST be prefixed: `MyClass.Init PROCEDURE`. Use `MEMBER('Parent.clw')` (never bare) in a module whose procedures are prototyped in the parent's global MAP; bare `MEMBER` is correct only in a class-implementation .clw.
6. **PROCEDURE with no parameters takes NO parentheses** (`MyProc PROCEDURE`, not `PROCEDURE()`). `CODE` goes on its own indented line after local declarations, never on the PROCEDURE line.
7. **References use `&=`**, not `=` (`MyRef &= MyObject`, `MyRef &= NULL`). `NEW` allocates, and every NEW needs a matching `DISPOSE`.
8. **Parameters:** `*TYPE` = by reference (not `&`), `<TYPE x>` = omittable (not `?`), checked with `OMITTED(n)`. Return type follows the parameter list: `PROCEDURE(LONG x),STRING`; add `,PROC` to allow ignoring the return value.
9. **ROUTINEs are called with `DO RoutineName`** — never with parentheses or as a bare name. They share the procedure's locals; no parameters, no return values.
10. **CLEAR the queue buffer before ADD** (other fields keep garbage). SORT takes field references with +/- prefixes: `SORT(Q, +Q.Name, -Q.Value)` — never a string field name.
11. **Reserved words cannot be identifiers** (ACCEPT, CASE, CODE, DATA, END, LOOP, NEW...). `SELF`/`PARENT` cannot name locals or parameters in class methods. Full lists in references/syntax-basics.md.
12. **Use ACCEPT (not plain LOOP/ACCEPTED) for window event processing:** `ACCEPT / CASE EVENT() / OF EVENT:Accepted / CASE FIELD()...`.
13. **Functions with a return type must return on every path** — no falling off the end.
14. **COM methods use direct brace syntax** `ctrl{'MethodName()'}` — never `ctrl{PROP:OLE} = '...'` (unreliable). COM property names are case-sensitive.
15. **Template files (.tpl/.tpw): `#AT` cannot be nested inside `#IF`** — put the `#IF` INSIDE the `#AT` body. And `OMITTED()` only works in the scope where the parameter is declared (fails silently inside ABC class methods) — stash params into procedure-locals at top level. Details and working embeds in references/templates.md.

16. **`DECIMAL` cannot be a value parameter or a return type** (compile errors). Use `*DECIMAL` by reference, or `REAL`/`LONG`. There is no `POWER()` — use `(2) ^ (n)`. Calling a returning procedure as a statement without `,PROC` (including `GETINI`) draws the warning `Calling function as procedure` — add `,PROC` to the prototype or assign the result.
17. **`OMIT('token')` ends at the first occurrence of that exact text anywhere, even inside a `!`/`!!` comment.** `MODULE` blocks belong inside a `MAP`, and the `MODULE('name')` must match the .clw that defines the procedure.

## When Generating Clarion Examples

Use realistic Clarion-convention names, show complete context (declare all variables), align property assignments, comment with `!`, and follow proper indentation. Full guidelines in references/syntax-basics.md.
