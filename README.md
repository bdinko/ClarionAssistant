## What is Clarion Assistant?

Clarion Assistant is an IDE addin that brings AI-powered code intelligence to [Clarion](https://softvelocity.com) developers. It runs as a docked terminal pane inside the Clarion IDE, giving you a conversational coding assistant that understands your entire codebase.

Ask it to write Clarion code, explain procedures, refactor classes, build COM controls, convert Clarion apps to C#, or navigate your solution &mdash; all without leaving the IDE.

### Key Capabilities

- **Write and edit Clarion code** directly in the IDE editor
- **Multi-tab terminal** &mdash; multiple Claude Code sessions with independent workspaces
- **Language Server (LSP)** &mdash; real-time code intelligence with go-to-definition, find references, hover info, diagnostics, and rename support
- **CodeGraph** &mdash; solution-wide code intelligence via SQL queries over every symbol, relationship, and call chain
- **DocGraph** &mdash; instant search across 14,000+ indexed documentation chunks (Clarion core, CapeSoft, Icetips, and more)
- **SchemaGraph** &mdash; database schema intelligence from Clarion dictionaries, SQL Server, SQLite, and PostgreSQL
- **Source Control** &mdash; GitHub and Bitbucket integration with per-solution repo linking
- **Build tools** &mdash; build solutions, individual apps, or C# COM controls without leaving the chat
- **Class intelligence** &mdash; parse CLASS definitions, sync .inc/.clw, generate method stubs
- **Application tree** &mdash; open .app files, list procedures, navigate the embeditor
- **Monaco source editor** &mdash; the default editor for Clarion `.clw`/`.inc` source: syntax highlighting, folding, F12/Ctrl+Click go-to-definition, inline diagnostics, and completion (toggleable under Options &rarr; Clarion Assistant &rarr; Editor Surfaces)
- **Smart Formatter (Ctrl+I)** &mdash; reformats Clarion code with structure indentation and aligned declarations; configurable
- **CA Embeditor** &mdash; use Clarion's own **Embeditor Source** (right-click a procedure, or the Views toolbar button) and a fast Monaco/WebView2 editor overlays the native embeditor automatically; edits save straight back with Clarion-native Save &amp; Exit
- **Embed navigation (Ctrl+J / Ctrl+B)** &mdash; jump to the next/previous *filled* embed, the same keys the native Clarion embeditor uses (#185); the toolbar arrows and an unfiltered walk over every embed are there too, and all of it is rebindable
- **Code Snippets (Ctrl+Shift+J)** &mdash; classic Clarion template-picker parity: insert reusable code with tab-stops and a `${SELECTED}` placeholder, managed from Settings &rarr; Snippets
- **CA Explorer** &mdash; docked pad showing the CA Embeditor's open procedure: its Local, Module &amp; Global Data, Declared Tables, Other Files, and their Keys, Columns, and Relations; drag a field to the editor or Window designer, copy/paste variables native-style, and a Cheat Sheet tab of editor shortcuts
- **Evaluate Code** &mdash; interactive code review for entire apps, procedures, open files, or selected code
- **CA Find & Replace** &mdash; dockable Find pad or classic in-editor overlay (your pick), Find-All with results in their own editor tab, and one shared history across every CA surface
- **Document Structure** &mdash; fly-out outline of the current buffer with symbol icons, Class &#9656; Methods regrouping, and filtering; click to navigate
- **Diff viewer** &mdash; Monaco-based side-by-side diffs with syntax highlighting, live-buffer diffing, and a current-line comparison panel
- **Knowledge system** &mdash; persistent cross-session memory for decisions, patterns, and gotchas
- **Zoom persistence** &mdash; Ctrl+mousewheel zoom is saved and restored across sessions

## What's New (Unreleased)

### Unsupported Windows is reported, not a blank terminal, and the installer refuses it ([#236](https://github.com/ClarionLive/ClarionAssistant/issues/236))

Clarion Assistant's terminals need Windows 10 version 1809 or Windows Server 2019, or later: they run on the Windows ConPTY API, which first shipped in that release, and Claude Code has the same minimum. On older Windows, such as Server 2016, a tab used to open empty with no explanation. It now says which Windows build it found and what it needs. Any other failure to start the assistant is shown in the tab too, instead of leaving it blank. The installer now checks the Windows version before installing.

### UltimateCOM: COM controls on different threads no longer crash the app ([#235](https://github.com/ClarionLive/ClarionAssistant/issues/235))

The UltimateCOM class that Clarion Assistant installs into `accessory\libsrc\win` kept one event queue for the whole program but locked it per control, so two COM controls on different threads (for example one on the main frame and one in an MDI child) could raise events at the same moment and free each other's event data, which crashed with an access violation in `WindowManager.Ask`. The queue now has a single shared lock, and each control's thread only ever sees and removes its own events. `UltimateCOM.inc` is unchanged, so existing apps and templates need nothing but a recompile.

### Thanks

- **[@Aarhusdk](https://github.com/Aarhusdk)** &mdash; [#235](https://github.com/ClarionLive/ClarionAssistant/issues/235): a production crash traced to its root cause with DebugView timings, a complete patch, and a retest on the affected install before we had even looked at it.

## What's New in v5.9

**Why 5.9.0 and not 5.8.2.** Clarion Assistant is joining the **Clarion Addin Registry**, so it can be found and updated from **AddinFinder** inside the IDE. That required our version number to become a single value that the addin manifest, the installer and the git tag all agree on &mdash; and it could not be 5.8.2. See the versioning entry below.

<!-- release-docs: covered=mcp,mcp-server,codegraph -->
### Clarion Assistant's tools now run without the Clarion IDE

There is a new **`clarion-mcp-server`**: the editor-agnostic half of Clarion Assistant, as a standalone program that speaks **MCP over stdio**. Point any MCP client at it &mdash; Claude Code in **Sublime Text**, in **VS Code**, or in a plain terminal &mdash; and you get Clarion intelligence in an editor that is not the IDE. This is for Clarion developers who hand-code and would rather not work in the Clarion IDE at all.

```
clarion-mcp-server --stdio --solution C:\Path\To\Your.sln
```

It serves **61 of the 118 tools**: the documentation search across SoftVelocity and every third-party vendor you have installed, the knowledge base, the LSP tools, the dictionary and SQL schema tools, CodeGraph indexing and queries, file and Everything search, and Clarion class analysis. Indexing works fully &mdash; it reads your `.red` redirection file the way the compiler does, so a solution with one hand-written source file still indexes the ABC library behind it.

The other **57 are withheld on purpose**, because they drive the IDE itself: opening files in the editor, the app tree, the embeditor, the designer. An MCP client reads the tool list as a promise about what it can do, so a tool that could only ever fail is worse than one that is honestly absent. The addin is unchanged and still offers all 118.

**Both can be running at once.** If your IDE and a standalone server both index the same solution, they no longer collide: a full re-index wipes the database before rebuilding it, so two overlapping runs used to be able to destroy each other's work and leave a graph pointing at code that had been deleted from it. Whichever starts second is now turned away, and told which process holds the database. A run whose process is killed &mdash; a deploy, a crash, Task Manager &mdash; releases immediately and leaves nothing stale behind.

<!-- release-docs: covered=mcp,schemagraph -->
### The assistant now knows which dictionary your app uses ([#210](https://github.com/ClarionLive/ClarionAssistant/issues/210))

Ask *"compare the table definition for ITEM and ITEMSERVICE"* and the assistant used to go looking &mdash; through old SQL scripts, then through whatever `.dctx` it could find on disk, which for the reporter was a stale one from a different project. It had no better option: **nothing told it which dictionary the open app is bound to**, and the schema tools picked their database by scanning the solution folder and taking the first `.schemagraph.db` the filesystem listed. Unordered, silent, and wrong often enough.

Two things change. **`get_app_info` now returns the dictionary path** straight from the app's Global Properties, and a new **`get_app_dictionary`** reads that dictionary *live* from the IDE &mdash; tables, prefixes, drivers, and per table its fields, keys and relationships &mdash; with no export and no ingest, so it can never be stale. The comparison above is now one call. The SchemaGraph tools look at the open app's own dictionary database first, and **every schema answer now says which database it came from and why it was chosen**, so a wrong pick is visible instead of confidently wrong.

<!-- release-docs: covered=lsp -->
### The bundled language server now actually starts

If you run Clarion Assistant **without** Mark Sarson's ClarionLsp addin, the bundled language server has never worked &mdash; every `lsp_` tool failed with the server unreachable. The cause was three bytes: .NET builds the pipe to a child process from the console's encoding and flushes that encoding's byte-order mark as it does so, and those three bytes arrived ahead of our first message. The server rejected the message and blamed its header, which was perfectly correct, so the real culprit sat one step upstream of everything the error pointed at. It has been masked all this time because ClarionLive users generally *do* have ClarionLsp installed, and Clarion Assistant hands LSP work to it when it is there.

Go-to-definition, find-references, hover, document symbols and diagnostics now work with nothing installed but Clarion itself.

<!-- release-docs: covered=skills -->
### The Clarion skills are a fifth of the size, and lose nothing

The nine largest skills have been rewritten: **313,000 characters down to 61,000**, roughly **78,000 tokens down to about 15,000** across the set. A session only ever loads each skill's short name and description up front; a skill's full body is read when the skill is actually used. So the saving shows up when a skill fires &mdash; a COM-control or embeditor task no longer pulls tens of thousands of tokens of instructions into the conversation before any work starts. ([#212](https://github.com/ClarionLive/ClarionAssistant/issues/212) &mdash; an earlier version of this note said skills load in full into every session, which was wrong.)

Nothing was deleted. The detail moved into 52 `references/` files that a skill reads *only when it actually needs them*, so invoking one now costs around 1,500&ndash;2,000 tokens plus whatever it genuinely reads, instead of the whole skill at once.

While rewriting them we also corrected the target framework. A find-and-replace had at some point turned every "net472 or net48" into "net48 or net48", which quietly made `net48` look like the only supported answer across seven files; the real COM controls target **net472**, and the skills now say so.

### CA Embeditor: the keys that used to do nothing now reach the IDE ([#192](https://github.com/ClarionLive/ClarionAssistant/issues/192))

Inside a CA Embeditor the editor swallowed most of Clarion's own shortcuts. **Ctrl+F4** (close), **Ctrl+O** (open) and **Alt+&lt;letter&gt;** now reach the IDE, the last of these by matching the letter against the real menu mnemonics rather than a hardcoded list &mdash; so it keeps working if the menus change. Keys are routed through the workbench menu itself, which means the IDE does what it would normally do rather than us reimplementing it.

### CA Embeditor: Ctrl+F4 on unsaved work now asks, because Clarion asks

Closing a dirty embeditor with Ctrl+F4 discarded the edits **silently**. The CA Editor prompted and the embeditor did not, which made it look arbitrary. The prompt was never broken: Clarion raises *"Save Changes in Embed Editor?"* by consulting the **native** editor's dirty flag, and our overlay never set it, so Clarion saw a clean embed and closed. We now flush the Monaco edits into the native embed and set that flag *before* the close is dispatched, so **Clarion raises its own dialog** &mdash; exact parity by construction, nothing imitated. Answering **Yes** saves the edits you can see rather than the stale native buffer underneath, which would have been a quieter and worse bug than the missing prompt. The toolbar's **red X** asks too, matched word for word to Clarion's dialog, and answering **Cancel** leaves you editing with your work still protected.

### CA Embeditor: an orphaned overlay is now torn down for real

When the native embed closed underneath the overlay &mdash; Errors-pane navigation opening the module source, a native cancel, an app-gen regeneration &mdash; the overlay kept its text and still looked healthy, while Save reported *"nothing to save"* and Cancel blanked the buffer. A teardown hook existed for exactly this and had **never once fired**: it subscribed to a `Disposed` event that does not exist on that class in this Clarion fork, and the null check meant to guard the subscription swallowed the failure, so the safety net read as present in the source while being connected to nothing.

### Ctrl+Q now shows Clarion's own confirmation, not ours ([#193](https://github.com/ClarionLive/ClarionAssistant/issues/193))

The Ctrl+Q confirmation was a web-styled dialog that looked nothing like the rest of the IDE. It is now the **native Windows dialog**, and it is scoped to the embeditor rather than firing globally.

<!-- release-docs: covered=claude,encoding -->
### New Chat no longer overwrites your CLAUDE.md ([#227](https://github.com/ClarionLive/ClarionAssistant/issues/227))

Opening a **New Chat** with no working directory set started the terminal in your user profile, and Clarion Assistant then copied its own instructions over `<working folder>\.claude\CLAUDE.md` on every launch &mdash; which there meant your **global** `%USERPROFILE%\.claude\CLAUDE.md`. The same code overwrote a hand-written project `CLAUDE.md`, and replaced `settings.local.json` wholesale, which is where Claude Code keeps your "don't ask again" permissions.

Clarion Assistant now **never writes into your user Claude folder** (`%USERPROFILE%\.claude`, or `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` if set) &mdash; not `CLAUDE.md`, not `settings.local.json`. In a project it only refreshes a `CLAUDE.md` that begins with its own opening lines, and only creates `settings.local.json` or replaces the one-line file it wrote itself. Where it can't write the file, it hands its instructions to Claude on the command line instead, so every terminal still gets them. **If you were hit by this, your original global `CLAUDE.md` is not restored automatically** &mdash; restore it from File History, OneDrive or another backup; the [#227 thread](https://github.com/ClarionLive/ClarionAssistant/issues/227) lists the places to look.

Related, and older: the Clarion Assistant **status line has never worked**. Its `settings.local.json` was written with a UTF-8 byte-order mark, and Claude Code parses that file with `JSON.parse`, which rejects a BOM &mdash; so the whole file was ignored. Every file we write for a non-.NET reader is now BOM-free, and a build guard fails the deploy if one ever regresses.

<!-- release-docs: covered=encoding -->
### Clarion source stays in its own encoding ([#203](https://github.com/ClarionLive/ClarionAssistant/issues/203))

The `write_file` tool wrote every `.clw` / `.inc` back as **UTF-8**, whatever it was before. An `ø` stored in an ANSI file as one byte came back as two, and Clarion shows that as `Ã¸` &mdash; in the editor, and in every string literal the compiler bakes into your program. `append_to_file` appended UTF-8 onto ANSI files, leaving one file in two encodings, and creating a class from a model, generating a `.clw` from an `.inc`, appending method stubs and the structure designer all did the same.

All of them now write Clarion source in **the file's own encoding**: an ANSI file stays ANSI, a genuinely UTF-8 file (one with a BOM, or already holding UTF-8 characters) stays UTF-8, and new or all-ASCII source files use Windows' ANSI code page, the one the Clarion IDE uses. A character the file's code page cannot hold &mdash; an emoji, say &mdash; is **refused with an error** naming it, and the file is left untouched, rather than silently becoming `?`. Files already converted won't convert themselves back; restore them from version control or re-save them as ANSI.

<!-- release-docs: covered=lsp -->
### The bundled language server is now v1.0.5 ([#224](https://github.com/ClarionLive/ClarionAssistant/issues/224))

The server that ships with Clarion Assistant moves from v1.0.2 to **v1.0.5**, synced through a hardened `Sync-LspServer.ps1 -Pure` that now verifies the shipped server matches the pin ([PR #186](https://github.com/ClarionLive/ClarionAssistant/pull/186)). Along the way we found the installer had kept packaging **v1.0.0** since the v1.0.2 re-pin in September; no release carried that (5.8.x shipped 1.0.0 with a matching manifest), but 5.9.0 would have. The installer now takes its server from the same pin as everything else.

<!-- release-docs: covered=folding -->
### Folding understands a LOOP closed by UNTIL or WHILE ([#222](https://github.com/ClarionLive/ClarionAssistant/issues/222))

A `LOOP` terminated by `UNTIL` or `WHILE` &mdash; valid Clarion, and the Language Reference's own example &mdash; never closed its fold, so it swallowed everything after it. The CA Editor and Embeditor now ask the language server for fold ranges ([PR #223](https://github.com/ClarionLive/ClarionAssistant/pull/223)), and the editor's own fallback, used while the server is starting or slow, closes a LOOP on `UNTIL` / `WHILE` too. A name like `While:Count` is not mistaken for a terminator.

<!-- release-docs: covered=formatter,embeditor -->
### A LOOP closed by UNTIL or WHILE is no longer an error, and Ctrl+I keeps it level

Folding was not the only part of the editor that thought a `LOOP` needed an `END`. In an embed slot, the structure check underlined `LOOP ... UNTIL x` with *"LOOP is not terminated with END or '.'"*, and **Ctrl+I** indented the `UNTIL` line as part of the loop body &mdash; and everything after it one level too deep. Both now treat `UNTIL` / `WHILE` as closing the innermost `LOOP`, and only a `LOOP`: with an `IF` on top it is still an ordinary line, and the pre-condition form `LOOP WHILE x ... END` still needs its `END`.

<!-- release-docs: covered=formatter -->
### Ctrl+I no longer moves a loop's label off column 1

A labelled structure such as `MyLoop LOOP` &mdash; the label that `BREAK MyLoop` and `CYCLE MyLoop` name &mdash; had its label indented into the code column by **Ctrl+I**, and a Clarion label that isn't in column 1 no longer compiles. The formatter also never opened the structure, so its body stayed flush and its `END` closed the wrong block. A labelled `LOOP`, `IF`, `CASE`, `ACCEPT`, `EXECUTE` or `BEGIN` now keeps its label in column 1 and lays out exactly as the unlabelled form would.

<!-- release-docs: covered=lsp,mcp,editor -->
### The language-server tools work from a plain Chat, and say why when they can't

Started with the **Chat** button rather than **Work With Open Solution**, the assistant's `lsp_*` tools had no solution even with one open in the IDE, so every call answered *"LSP not running"* &mdash; and `lsp_start` ignored the folder it was given, then blamed a *"client handshake"* that had never been attempted. The tools now follow the solution open in the IDE (and restart on it when you switch), `lsp_start` uses the folder or `.sln` you name, and a start that doesn't happen says which reason applies. **Find All References** also opens the file in the server before asking; without that, a request from the MAP line came back as a single zero-width hit, where the server finds the prototype, the implementation and a `START()` call. **Shift+F12** in the CA Editor no longer silently does Go to Definition.

<!-- release-docs: covered=schema -->
### PostgreSQL: ingest no longer aborts on aggregates, and errors say what happened ([#201](https://github.com/ClarionLive/ClarionAssistant/issues/201), [#188](https://github.com/ClarionLive/ClarionAssistant/issues/188))

Indexing a PostgreSQL database that had a user-defined **aggregate** failed outright with `42809 wrong_object_type`, and the Index status cell said only *"error"*. Aggregates are now skipped (window functions are still indexed &mdash; only aggregates break `pg_get_functiondef()`), and the status cell shows the real message. **Test Connection** now says plainly when `Npgsql.dll` is missing, instead of showing the .NET loader error &mdash; and says something different when it is present but can't be loaded, so a broken install no longer looks like a missing one. Bundling Npgsql with the installer is still to come.

<!-- release-docs: covered=build-tools -->
### A locked .app is reported as a lock ([#204](https://github.com/ClarionLive/ClarionAssistant/issues/204))

`build_app` and `generate_source` default to the app open in your IDE &mdash; which is the IDE holding it open &mdash; so ClarionCL failed with *"Could not gain access to MyApp.ap~"* / *"Cannot open application … (status 32)"*, reading exactly like a template or source error. The result now carries a **DIAGNOSIS** line saying the `.app` is locked by a Clarion IDE, most likely this one, and to close it there and retry.

### CA Editor and Embeditor: Mark Word on Ctrl+W ([#229](https://github.com/ClarionLive/ClarionAssistant/issues/229))

**Ctrl+W** marks the word at the caret. A word is letters, digits and underscores &mdash; the colon is deliberately not part of one &mdash; so in `LOC:CustomerName` it marks just `LOC` or just `CustomerName`, the one way to take either half on its own (double-click takes the whole name). Press **Ctrl+W** again while that half is still selected and it widens to the whole `LOC:CustomerName`, the same word double-click takes. It works at every cursor, only changes the selection, and can be rebound in the gear panel's **Keyboard** section. Requested and contributed by Rick Martin ([PR #231](https://github.com/ClarionLive/ClarionAssistant/pull/231)).

<!-- release-docs: covered=mcp,embeditor -->
### The embeditor tools reach large procedures, and never save over your unsaved edits ([PR #198](https://github.com/ClarionLive/ClarionAssistant/pull/198))

On a large procedure `apply_embed_edits` and `open_procedure_embed` always failed with *"UI thread did not respond within 30s"* while the IDE was simply working: every UI-thread tool shared one 30-second budget, and a single native embeditor open can take 45 seconds by itself. The four slow tools &mdash; `open_procedure_embed`, `apply_embed_edits`, `save_and_close_embeditor` and `warmup_abc` &mdash; now get **180 seconds**; everything else keeps 30. To give every UI-thread tool more, add `Mcp.UiToolTimeoutSeconds` to `%APPDATA%\ClarionAssistant\settings.txt` (5&ndash;600 seconds; it never lowers a tool below its own minimum). `apply_embed_edits` can now use a procedure you already have open in the embeditor, but only when it has **no unsaved changes** and no CA Embeditor is showing it &mdash; otherwise it refuses and writes nothing, so it can never save your edits along with its own. And a call that timed out **no longer saves late**: a call the IDE never started does not run, `apply_embed_edits` discards instead of saving, `save_and_close_embeditor` does not save, and the message says what really happened.

<!-- release-docs: covered=lsp -->
### `lsp_diagnostics` no longer calls a file clean too early ([#216](https://github.com/ClarionLive/ClarionAssistant/issues/216))

`lsp_diagnostics` is how the assistant checks its own edits, and it could answer *"no errors"* before the language server had finished. Since v1.0.4 the server ends every analysis with an explicit status for the file, and the bundled client now waits for it: only a **complete** for this file, at the version we sent, ends the wait, and running out of time still answers *"pending"*, never *"clean"*. Older servers keep the previous behaviour. With Mark Sarson's ClarionLsp addin installed, requests go through the addin, and clarion-lsp v1.4.3 does the same wait.

<!-- release-docs: covered=editor,monaco -->
### CA Editor: squiggles on the right line, the whole font list, and no white flash ([#176](https://github.com/ClarionLive/ClarionAssistant/issues/176), [#184](https://github.com/ClarionLive/ClarionAssistant/issues/184), [#195](https://github.com/ClarionLive/ClarionAssistant/issues/195))

**Squiggles no longer land lines off:** a slow diagnostics reply to an older request could overwrite a newer one and draw its lines over a buffer that had since changed; a stale reply is now dropped and a fresh check runs. **The Font family box shows the whole list:** the browser filtered it by the font already in the box, so only that font appeared. It is now a **plain dropdown** &mdash; *Default* plus the same fonts, the whole list every time, and a pick applies at once. A saved font that is not in the list (an older fallback list, or a font imported from VS Code) is kept as an extra entry rather than dropped. **No white flash on open:** everything shown before the editor paints now uses the editor's own background in the CA Editor and the CA Embeditor, and under **Windows High Contrast** the contrast theme's window colour.

<!-- release-docs: covered=completion,embeditor -->
### Completion lists a member once ([#187](https://github.com/ClarionLive/ClarionAssistant/issues/187))

Member completion showed some methods twice, because the language server sent them twice and nothing removed the repeat. Identical items are now listed once; overloads with the same bare name but a different signature are kept. Found along the way: in the CA Embeditor, a buffer that already started with `MEMBER` or `PROGRAM` sent every position to the language server **one line low** and mapped every answer back one line high &mdash; fixed, though not shown to be the reporter's cause. The separate report in that issue about completion after `st.` in a data embed could not be reproduced and is not claimed fixed.

<!-- release-docs: covered=embeditor -->
### The embeditor finds generated modules through your redirection file ([PR #228](https://github.com/ClarionLive/ClarionAssistant/pull/228))

The CA Embeditor looked for the procedure's generated `.clw` only **next to the `.app`**, so if your `.red` sends generated source elsewhere, every embed quietly fell back to a path that does not exist, and diagnostics and navigation ran against nothing. It now resolves through the redirection file, searching `[Debug32]`, `[Release32]`, `[Debug]` and `[Release]` before `[Common]`, and honouring the `.app` folder's own `.red` ahead of the solution's. **Behaviour change:** Clarion only honours a local `.red` named for the running version (`Clarion120.red`, say) and ignores any other `*.red` in the folder; Clarion Assistant used to take the first `*.red` it found in a solution or app folder, and now follows Clarion's rule, so a misnamed or backup `.red` is ignored. This came out of [#179](https://github.com/ClarionLive/ClarionAssistant/issues/179) but does **not** fix its access violation.

<!-- release-docs: covered=instance-coord -->
### A hung Clarion no longer sits on the multi-instance roster forever ([PR #208](https://github.com/ClarionLive/ClarionAssistant/pull/208))

A Clarion IDE that hung without exiting kept its place in the list of running instances the others check for procedure conflicts, so they kept colliding with it until a reboot. An instance that stops responding is now dropped after about **two minutes of not responding continuously**. One slow answer is not enough, because a busy IDE mid-build or mid-generation gives the same answer, and a busy IDE that was dropped puts itself back once it responds again.

<!-- release-docs: covered=explorer -->
### CA Explorer matches the running Clarion to the right version ([#209](https://github.com/ClarionLive/ClarionAssistant/issues/209))

When Clarion's record of the current version is missing, stale or says *"(Current ...)"*, the version is worked out from the running `Clarion.exe`'s bin folder &mdash; and it took the **first** entry with that folder, although every install registers its Clarion.NET compiler on the same bin. The IDE could be treated as its own .NET compiler. It now prefers the Win32 entry whose build number matches the running exe. The same version decides the `.red` file, the language server and CodeGraph, not only the CA Explorer banner and recents.

<!-- release-docs: covered=mcp -->
### `append_to_file` no longer adds a blank line ([#232](https://github.com/ClarionLive/ClarionAssistant/issues/232))

It always wrote a line break before the new text, so appending to a file that already ended with one left a blank line. It now adds the break only when the file does not already end in one; encoding handling is unchanged.

<!-- release-docs: covered=editor,embeditor -->
### Large procedures no longer crash the IDE from the CA Editor or Embeditor

On an 86,722-line, 3.2 MB generated module the 32-bit Clarion IDE could die out of memory with a CA Embeditor open, because the editor sent its **whole buffer** with every hover, completion, definition, diagnostics, outline and folding request. Both Monaco editors now send the buffer **once per edit** and requests only name the version they are about &mdash; twenty hovers on a 3.2 MB buffer went from 66 MB of traffic to 3.3 MB. The diagnostics timeout now grows with the buffer (up to 60 seconds). That fixed the crash but not the wait; the next entry fixes the wait.

<!-- release-docs: covered=editor,embeditor,lsp,codegraph,schemagraph -->
### Completion, hover and squiggles are instant on large procedures

On that same 86,722-line module, completion in the CA Embeditor showed *"Loading…"* for four seconds and then *"No suggestions"*. A hover took 1 to 35 seconds, and a `DO` of a missing routine took about **five minutes** to get its squiggle. The native embeditor is instant, and that is the bar. We measured first. The language server re-analyses the **whole** module on every edit, and is just as slow in VS Code, so Clarion Assistant now **answers first from what it already knows** and treats the language server as a late extra:

- **Completion:** your procedure's locals, **parameters**, routines and group fields; class members, including `SELF.` in a `ThisWindow` method with inherited `WindowManager` members; CodeGraph procedures and globals; `PRE:` fields from the **live** dictionary (no ingest); and keywords.
- **Hover:** the same sources. Keywords, attributes and built-ins now show **what they do**: `DERIVED`, `RETURN`, `CLIP(STRING string)` and so on, from the language server's own data files.
- **Squiggles:** structure errors and a `DO` of a missing routine appear as soon as they're computed. The language server's squiggles are added when they arrive.

Measured on that module, from keystroke to list on screen: completion **43 ms** typical and **119 ms** at worst, hover **7&ndash;35 ms**, and the `DO` squiggle in under a second.

- **Typing no longer ships the module around.** Each keystroke used to send the whole 3.2 MB buffer to the IDE. It now sends a few hundred characters around the caret, and the full buffer goes over only when you pause.
- **CodeGraph lookups went from 150&ndash;500 ms to about 0.2 ms.** They keep one connection open and use new case-insensitive indexes. Existing databases get the indexes automatically, built once in the background, with no re-index needed.

**Also fixed along the way:**
- Locals declared before a `ThisWindow CLASS` were invisible to completion and hover in every ABC procedure.
- Other procedures' parameters were offered as globals.
- After a save and reopen, squiggles could be painted from an **older** version of the file, landing on the wrong lines and even inside comments. Diagnostics now have to belong to the text on screen.
- A language-server crash is now logged instead of vanishing.
- The bundled language server now starts as soon as a solution opens. It used to wait for a Clarion Assistant chat tab, so with only the IDE and a CA Embeditor open it never started at all.

<!-- release-docs: covered=header,schema -->
### The header has tabs: Solution, Schema Sources and Source Control

Schema Sources and Source Control are settings of the **solution**, but they lived in a collapsed *"Solution Settings"* bar inside each chat tab, where most people never found them. They are now tabs of the header itself, beside **Solution**, and show on every tab, Home included. The **Schema Sources** tab shows how many sources are linked, and both follow the solution selected in the header.

- **The header has a fixed height.** The drag bar under it is gone.
- **&#10697; beside SOLUTION** copies the solution's full path to the clipboard.
- **RED is a link.** Click it to open the `.red` file in an IDE editor tab. When no redirection file could be found it stays a warning and is not clickable.
- **The &#9678; "Show/hide LSP Diagnostics bar" toggle is gone**, and so is the bar. Squiggles in the CA Editor and CA Embeditor show the same diagnostics where you are looking.

<!-- release-docs: covered=close -->
### Clarion closes faster

Closing the IDE could take about **20 seconds**, even when no CA Embeditor had been opened. Two causes came in during this release cycle, and both are fixed. The **Schema Sources / Source Control** panel, a browser component, was created in every session and had to be torn down at close; it is now created only the first time you open one of those tabs. And the language server was stopped **on the UI thread** when the solution closed, holding the IDE for about 0.4 seconds; it now stops in the background.

Closing is noticeably faster. Measured with an external timer: about **8 seconds** from the solution closing to Clarion exiting, of which Clarion Assistant's own share is about half a second; the rest is Clarion's own teardown. To diagnose a slow close, `%APPDATA%\ClarionAssistant\shutdown.log` now records a `[close +N ms]` line for each step.

<!-- release-docs: covered=version -->
### Clarion Assistant follows Build > Set Clarion Version

The IDE keeps a Clarion version per solution (**Build > Set Clarion Version**). Clarion Assistant read it only at startup or on a solution change, and a version picked in its own **VERSION** dropdown was one global setting that beat the IDE forever &mdash; honoured by some parts of Clarion Assistant and not others. Now **Clarion Assistant shows the Clarion version the IDE has selected and no longer has its own version picker**: VERSION is a read-only display, followed when the IDE's choice changes (the `.red` reloads and the bundled language server restarts), and **every part of Clarion Assistant uses the same version**. With the IDE on **(Current Version)** it shows the running Clarion's own version, marked **(IDE)**; &#8635; re-reads the IDE's choice. The stale mix-up where a Clarion 12 IDE showed `Clarion 10 Active And Updated (saved)` is gone: versions saved by the old dropdown are simply ignored.

<!-- release-docs: covered=explorer -->
### CA Explorer's header says what it means

The header read like `Clarion10v8 · clbrws`, a version folder and a solution name run together. It now shows labelled lines: **APP** (or **SOLUTION** when no app is open), **VERSION**, **ROOT** and **RED**. Clicking **APP** shows the file in Windows Explorer, and **ROOT** opens the folder.

<!-- release-docs: covered=editor,formatter -->
### CA Embeditor: the caret and Enter stay with the code

Two older problems found in install testing. With **Can move caret behind EOL** and word wrap on, a click beside a wrapped line set the caret's goal column to about the window width, so later up/down moves padded lines out to ~column 125 and Enter carried that indent on; a click there is now an ordinary click. And **Enter after END**, **Enter** and **Ctrl+I** re-indent from the code you can see: the formatter counted structures from the top of the whole generated module, and code it does not model (such as `OMIT` / `COMPILE` blocks) could throw an embed's block out to column 125. Re-indenting now stays anchored to the surrounding code.

<!-- release-docs: covered=completion,ctrl-d,focus,knowledge -->
### Community fixes

- **Completion after `SELF.` and `PARENT.`** no longer resolves to an unrelated class ([PR #221](https://github.com/ClarionLive/ClarionAssistant/pull/221)) &mdash; a name lookup was matching ABPOPUP's explicit `SELF` parameter, so every `SELF.` offered `PopupClass` members.
- **Member completion on `GROUP` / `QUEUE`** is right again ([PR #219](https://github.com/ClarionLive/ClarionAssistant/pull/219)): a one-line `GROUP(T) END` no longer swallows the procedure's locals as its fields, and a typed `QUEUE(Type)` no longer uses its incomplete inline field list as the member filter.
- **Colon-qualified completion** no longer duplicates or truncates the name you typed ([PR #215](https://github.com/ClarionLive/ClarionAssistant/pull/215)).
- **A trailing period on an ordinary statement** now closes its structure in the embed-slot structure check, ending false *"unterminated"* warnings ([PR #226](https://github.com/ClarionLive/ClarionAssistant/pull/226)).
- **Ctrl+D** no longer opens the wrong designer when a structure keyword is used as a plain label, such as a variable named `report` ([PR #220](https://github.com/ClarionLive/ClarionAssistant/pull/220)).
- **The CodeGraph indexer's window buttons** work again &mdash; the editor's focus guard was taking focus back from them ([PR #217](https://github.com/ClarionLive/ClarionAssistant/pull/217)).
- **Knowledge entries can be retired**: `supersede_knowledge` and `remove_knowledge` let a wrong entry stop being injected, instead of only being contradicted by a newer one ([PR #199](https://github.com/ClarionLive/ClarionAssistant/pull/199)).

<!-- release-docs: covered=debugger,debugger-hook -->
### CA Debugger: the execution line and Run to Cursor work in the CA Editor

With the CA Editor (Monaco) in front, the CA Debugger painted **no execution-line marker**, because the navigation it used only scrolls. The CA Editor now paints the debugger's current line itself and keeps it across reloads and reopen. Right-clicking now offers **Run to Cursor**, which runs a paused debug session to the caret without going to the pad toolbar, and refuses rather than guessing if its tab did not become the active window. Clarion Assistant finds the debugger at runtime by assembly identity, so nothing changes if it isn't installed.

<!-- release-docs: covered=terminal,deploy,bom-guard -->
### Under the hood

- **Messaging in IDE terminals.** Claude Code 2.1.265 stopped resolving the MultiTerminal channel supplied on the command line, so every IDE terminal printed *"no MCP server configured with that name"* and quietly fell back to polling. The channel now arrives through the plugin.
- **Deploy is stricter.** It refuses to deploy onto a running Clarion, never reports success on a partial copy, fails when the shipped language server does not match its pin, and is gated on the BOM guard &mdash; which now also fails if it scanned nothing, rather than passing vacuously. `deploy.ps1` parses under Windows PowerShell 5.1 again.
- **The shipped language server is checked, not just its source.** Deploy and the installer build hash the `server.js` they ship and compare it with the pinned version's recorded hash; a proven mismatch is refused unless `-AllowUnpinnedLsp` is passed, and `Sync-LspServer.ps1 -Pure` refuses a non-git source tree unless `-TrustNonGitTree` is passed ([PR #191](https://github.com/ClarionLive/ClarionAssistant/pull/191)).
- **`deploy.ps1 -Version all` starts faster.** Its search for Clarion installs scanned every mounted drive, network shares included; it now scans local fixed drives only ([PR #211](https://github.com/ClarionLive/ClarionAssistant/pull/211)).

<!-- release-docs: covered=installer -->
### Installing no longer corrupts non-ASCII characters in your Claude Code settings ([#200](https://github.com/ClarionLive/ClarionAssistant/issues/200))

A follow-on to [#190](https://github.com/ClarionLive/ClarionAssistant/issues/190), and the same root cause: the installer's configuration step runs under **Windows PowerShell 5.1**, where two defaults are not what they appear. Reading `settings.json` without naming an encoding decoded it as the machine's **ANSI codepage**, so every non-ASCII character was mangled on the way *in* and written back mangled &mdash; a typographic apostrophe became `â€™`. Writing it back with `-Encoding UTF8` added a **byte-order mark** to a file that belongs to Claude Code, because that same token means *with* BOM on 5.1 and *without* on PowerShell 7. And a **successful** merge kept no backup at all: a copy was only ever written when the installer *refused* to write, which is why the 5.8 notes pointed people at a backup file the normal path never produced. All three are fixed, a backup is now written before the file is overwritten, and an already-BOM'd file from 5.8 is read correctly and cleaned. **Characters already mangled on disk cannot be recovered** &mdash; the original bytes are gone. The installer's configuration script is now covered by a regression test that runs it under a real 5.1 host and checks the result byte by byte.

### Version numbers now mean one thing ([#200](https://github.com/ClarionLive/ClarionAssistant/issues/200) groundwork for AddinFinder)

The released version is now **Major.Minor.Patch** &mdash; one number, shared by `Version.props`, the addin manifest and the git tag. Previously the third component was a build counter that incremented on **every compile**, so the manifest said `5.8.1165` while the release was tagged `v5.8.1` and the installer carried a third, hand-maintained `5.8.1`. AddinFinder compares the manifest against the release tag, so any disagreement shows as *"Update available"* permanently, and reinstalling cannot clear it.

**This is why the jump is to 5.9.0 rather than 5.8.2.** AddinFinder only ever lets a recorded version move *forward*, and it compares component by component &mdash; so against a manifest already reporting `5.8.1165`, the number `5.8.2` compares as **lower** (2 against 1165) and would have left every existing user stuck on that message forever, while looking perfectly correct on any fresh install. The build counter has not gone away: it still increments and still appears in the DLL's file properties and in the docked pad's title (`5.9.0.1165`), where it is useful for support.

### The About box now shows the full version number

The About box reported `5.9` where every other surface reports `5.9.0.1165`. It built the string from the assembly version's **Major and Minor only**, dropping the patch and the build counter &mdash; the two components that actually distinguish one install from another. It now shows all four, which matters mostly for support: the build counter is how you tell a deployed build apart from the one before it, and reading it off the About box is the quickest way to get it.

### The VS Code import preview no longer promises a font it cannot deliver

Importing settings from VS Code previews what will change. Where **Follow Clarion's editor options** is ticked some of those values are owned by the IDE rather than the pad, and the preview already warned about that on the indentation rows &mdash; but not on **Font size** and **Font family**, which are follow-mode-owned too. So the preview offered a font change, the import stored it correctly, and the editor carried on showing the IDE's font, leaving the setting looking silently ignored; unticking follow-mode reveals the imported value was there the whole time. The warning now appears on the font rows as well, and only when the IDE is actually reporting a font, so it never warns about a setting that would in fact have applied.

### Bundled skills: the marketplace ones said .NET 4.8, the templates build 4.7.2

The ClarionCOM skills that ship with Clarion Assistant told you your project targets **net48**. Both shipped templates target **net472** &mdash; `ClarionCOMTemplate.csproj` and `WebView2Template.csproj` alike. That is not a label being out by a decimal point: the deployment skill sent you to copy build output from `bin/Release/net48/`, **a path MSBuild never writes**, and the control checklist would fail a correctly configured project. Corrected throughout the four affected skills.

The blanket rule against generating Clarion code was also too broad, and is narrowed from *"never generate Clarion code examples"* to *"never hand-write per-control examples"*. The reason it needed narrowing: the Clarion templates cover the **inbound** half only &mdash; `UltimateCOM.tpl` and the `UltimateCOM` class handle instantiation, placement and events &mdash; while every outbound method call and data payload is hand-written by the developer with no guidance anywhere in the product. A fixed, reviewed calling-convention block now fills exactly that gap, checked against the SoftVelocity Help topics *"Parameter Passing to OLE/OCX Methods"* and *"Calling OLE Object Methods"*. The original concern, that improvised per-control Clarion would likely be wrong, is preserved and still enforced.

## What's New in v5.8.1

A patch release that fixes something 5.8 broke. Full notes: **[docs/releases/v5.8.1.md](docs/releases/v5.8.1.md)**.

<!-- release-docs: covered=installer -->
### Clarion starts again after installing the Markdown editor

Installing 5.8 could leave `accessory\addins\MarkdownEditor` holding **exactly one file** &mdash; the `.addin` manifest &mdash; and none of the assemblies it names. Clarion reads that manifest at startup, fails to load the DLL beside it, and **stops with two dialogs instead of opening**. The editor's files ship as one wildcard entry, and Inno Setup evaluates such an entry's install check *once per expanded file*; the manifest sorts alphabetically first, so it was written, and every remaining file then re-ran the check, found the manifest just written reporting the version being installed, took the "you already have this" branch and was skipped. The gate destroyed its own precondition. Reinstalling did not help &mdash; that lone manifest kept reporting the current version, so the broken state was exactly the state the repair logic refused to repair. The decision is now made once per Clarion version and frozen before the first write, and a manifest with no assembly beside it is treated as damage rather than as an install, which is what **repairs already-broken machines in place**. A copy of the editor newer than the bundled one is still left alone.

### Markdown editor v1.3.0

The bundled editor moves to **[v1.3.0](https://github.com/msarson/ClarionMarkdownEditor/releases/tag/v1.3.0)** &mdash; auto-refresh, remembered view preferences, and resizable panes.

> The Clarion Assistant addin itself is unchanged from 5.8: same binaries, same version stamp. Only the installer's logic and the Markdown editor it carries are different.

### Thanks

- The user who reported this on **Discord**, with both dialogs captured. The screenshots named the file and the path, which is what separated "the DLL is missing" from "the DLL cannot load" &mdash; very different bugs.

---

## What's New in v5.8

5.8 is the CodeGraph release &mdash; and one apology. Full notes: **[docs/releases/v5.8.0.md](docs/releases/v5.8.0.md)**.

> **Re-index your solutions and re-import your documentation after updating.** This release corrects what gets *read*, not what is already stored.

### Installing no longer wipes your Claude Code settings ([#190](https://github.com/ClarionLive/ClarionAssistant/issues/190))

Every install, on every machine, overwrote `%USERPROFILE%\.claude\settings.json` &mdash; Claude Code's own global configuration &mdash; leaving only the handful of keys the installer itself writes. `hooks`, `statusLine`, `model`, `tui`, your plugins and your own `permissions.allow` entries were gone, and losing `hooks` is the worst of it because nothing announces it. The installer runs its configuration step under Windows PowerShell 5.1 and the script asked for a JSON option that only exists in PowerShell 6+, so the parse failed every time &mdash; and the error handler mistook its own unsupported call for a corrupt user file, backed it up, and rebuilt from empty. **If this hit you, your settings are still on disk:** look next to the file for `settings.json.backup.` plus a timestamp. The parse works on both hosts now, a genuine failure leaves your file alone, a guard refuses any write that would drop a top-level key, and the installer build fails if any of its scripts would not load under real 5.1.

### CodeGraph: thirty times faster, and no longer confidently wrong

A full index of a 27-app production solution fell from **1:12 to 2:42**, with the output verified identical row by row. The correctness half matters more: "who calls X" could answer with the wrong X entirely, because every call in every app resolved to one arbitrary copy of a shared procedure name. Resolution is now scoped the way the compiler thinks, genuinely ambiguous picks are **marked** rather than asserted, and prototypes are told apart from implementations &mdash; which also fixes a documented dead-code query that was returning **98.7% false positives**.

Three whole categories of code had been invisible. **Procedures whose labels contain a colon** were never indexed at all &mdash; in generated Clarion that is the entire referential-integrity layer, so "what breaks if I delete from this table" returned nothing. **Routine bodies** were never scanned, because a `ROUTINE` label switched the scanner off and `DO ProcedureReturn` prefix-matched the PROCEDURE pattern. And **global data** &mdash; your PROGRAM file's declaration section &mdash; was skipped entirely, with references to an imported global landing on the importing app's copy instead of the declaration you navigate to. The test solution went from 478 thousand relationships to **1.1 million**.

### Indexing shows its work, and the tools stream it

Starting an index opens a **progress window**: apps ticked off as they parse, the file being read, a bar weighted by where the time actually goes, and an estimate seeded from your last run. It can be **cancelled** &mdash; a cancelled full index deletes the partial database rather than leaving something that passes for complete. The transcript is always written to `%APPDATA%\ClarionAssistant\codegraph-index.log`, and the window no longer steals focus from the IDE. Over MCP, `index_solution` and `index_codegraph` now stream live progress and return real completion stats instead of an hour of silence.

### Asking the assistant to build compiles what is on your screen

The assistant's build tools shelled straight out to `ClarionCL` without entering the IDE's build pipeline, so the hook that saves unsaved CA Editor tabs never ran &mdash; the toolbar button saved them, the assistant did not, and you got the stale build. Alongside it: **saving no longer throws the caret to line 1** (our own write looked like an external change to the native editor underneath, whose caret reset was then faithfully mirrored into view), and the editor no longer keeps its unsaved-changes dot on a file it has just saved. **`.tpl` and `.tpw`** listed in Editor Surfaces finally open in the editor, and writing an entry as `*.tpl` no longer produces a pattern that silently matches nothing.

### Markdown editor, embeditor, and per-environment history

Mark Sarson's **[Markdown editor](https://github.com/msarson/ClarionMarkdownEditor)** now ships in the installer, pinned like the bundled language server, and is left alone if you already have a newer copy. The **CA Embeditor** attaches in colon-named procedure suites ([#196](https://github.com/ClarionLive/ClarionAssistant/issues/196)) &mdash; on one reporter's application it had never attached once in six weeks. Two Clarion environments started with `/ConfigDir=` no longer **share one application history** ([#197](https://github.com/ClarionLive/ClarionAssistant/issues/197)); CA had been rebuilding the path from the executable's version stamp, and Clarion 11 and 11.1 both report `11.0`. Migration-free &mdash; a default install resolves to exactly the string it did before.

### Also fixed

**Documentation search stops mangling accented characters** &mdash; the ingester read UTF-8 documents as the machine's ANSI codepage, and the wrong encoding was passed *explicitly*, which is how it survived two previous sweeps. The **embedded assistant knows about every tool it has** in the copy that actually ships: 5.7 went out with a prompt missing 51 registered tools, because the fix had landed in a file that gets overwritten on every terminal start. A release **could ship with no language server** and say so in one grey line among thirty green ones. And CA terminals now **leave the MultiTerminal roster** when they close &mdash; three separate defects, the decisive one being that `localhost` stalled every call to its timeout, which had also left the Agents pad showing stale data.

## What's New in v5.7

5.7 is a parity-and-reliability release. Full notes: **[docs/releases/v5.7.0.md](docs/releases/v5.7.0.md)**.

### Native embeditor parity &mdash; Ctrl+J / Ctrl+B

The CA Embeditor answers **Ctrl+J** (next filled embed) and **Ctrl+B** (previous) like the native one, wrapping at either end and acting on the focused split pane ([#185](https://github.com/ClarionLive/ClarionAssistant/issues/185), BoxSoft). The code-snippet picker moves to **Ctrl+Shift+J** &mdash; Ctrl+J is classic Clarion's snippet gesture in the *text* editor, but the *embeditor* owes it to embed navigation &mdash; and becomes rebindable like every other command, so it can be put back if you prefer. An unfiltered **Next/Previous Embed (any)** ships unbound.

### Errors-pane navigation survives opening a generated .clw

Clicking a row for one procedure after another row had opened the generated `.clw` appeared to do nothing. The reveal was always computing the right line &mdash; but the embeditor is a view *inside* the application window rather than a tab of its own, so raising it needed both levels, and opening the `.clw` closes the native embed underneath, leaving a surface where **Save** said "nothing to save" and **Cancel** blanked the buffer. Such a row now goes to Clarion's own navigation, which re-opens the embeditor properly.

### A language server call can no longer freeze the IDE

An embed save or cancel could hang the IDE for close to a minute &mdash; measured at 57.7s &mdash; waiting synchronously on an async language-server call from the UI thread. An audit found **twelve** such sites, not the two reported, so the pattern is fixed rather than one more symptom. Separately, an application **global** flagged `'X' is not declared in this file` while hovering correctly as a global is suppressed pending the upstream fix ([Clarion-Extension issue 396](https://github.com/msarson/Clarion-Extension/issues/396)).

### Community fixes

**Go-to-definition** stops resolving to an unrelated procedure's local variable ([#182](https://github.com/ClarionLive/ClarionAssistant/pull/182)) &mdash; a guard the hover path already used and the definition path never called. The **editor follows Clarion's live font** ([#183](https://github.com/ClarionLive/ClarionAssistant/pull/183)): it had been reading a property the Options dialog no longer writes to, so font changes never reached the editor. Both from [@geircodes](https://github.com/geircodes). Reviewing #183 turned up a way to lose your own font &mdash; with following on, any unrelated gear change persisted the IDE's font as your stored preference &mdash; fixed before release, along with the same shape in cursor-behind-EOL.

### Folds, encoding, search, installer

Collapsed **folds** are restored on reopen (the state saved but always read back empty), and an ambiguous drifted fold is refused rather than collapsing the wrong region. The Windows-1252 **encoding** sweep is finished &mdash; nineteen more reads, two of them read-modify-*write* &mdash; and reads no longer decode every file twice. **CA Search** opens in your theme instead of always dark ([#181](https://github.com/ClarionLive/ClarionAssistant/issues/181)). The **installer** checks that a folder's Clarion version matches the row it was entered in, and a row now accepts several folders for the same version via **`+`**, closing the gap 5.5's known issues warned about.

## What's New in v5.6

Documentation search is the headline: PDF text extraction now works on every machine instead of only ones that happened to have a third-party tool installed, the extracted text is more accurate, and it is indexed so that a question is answered by the first result rather than the fifth query. Alongside that, a cycle of fixes across the diagnostics path, completion scoping, and the CA Editor's Monaco overlay &mdash; plus a build fix that restores Clarion 10 to the shipped set.

<!-- release-docs: covered=docgraph -->
### PDF documentation actually imports &mdash; and is correct (#167)

Importing a folder of PDFs reported "No documentation files found", naming `pdf` as supported in the very message saying nothing was there. The files were found. Text extraction shelled out to an external `pdftotext.exe` that CA never bundled and nothing it requires installs &mdash; not Git for Windows, contrary to what the code's own probe paths assumed. So PDF import worked only on machines where a developer happened to have put one, and silently produced nothing everywhere else.

Extraction is now in-process (PdfPig, Apache-2.0), so it works everywhere with no external dependency.

The bigger surprise was accuracy. Where the old path *did* run, it misaligned multi-column tables: in the Language Reference's date-picture table it paired `@D6` (`dd/mm/yyyy`) with `10/1959` &mdash; which is `@D14`'s value, and cannot be a `dd/mm/yyyy` rendering of any date &mdash; while dropping other cells entirely. Every row now reads correctly. Those tables are exactly what a Clarion developer searches the documentation for, so the old path was not merely unavailable; where it ran, it was indexing wrong answers.

> **Re-import your own PDFs.** Anything already in a personal DocGraph was indexed through the old path and keeps the old text. The bundled documentation shipped with this release is already rebuilt.

### Documentation search answers the question, not the index (#167)

Extraction being correct is not the same as the answer being findable. Asking which three categories `ASCIIFileClass`'s non-virtual methods divide into took **five** queries; it now takes one, and the answer is the first result.

Four things were wrong at once. **Nothing identified the owning class** &mdash; every chunk in the ABC Library Reference was labelled with the book's name, and since every ABC class has an identically-named "Occasional Use" subsection, results from five different classes interleaved with nothing to tell them apart. **Table-of-contents pages outranked real content**: 28.7% of the index was dot-leader lines, which are almost pure keyword, so searching a class name returned page-number lists ahead of prose. **Clarion keywords lifted out of example code became headings** &mdash; 486 chunks titled `ACCEPT`, `PROGRAM` or `RETURN`, including the one holding the ASCIIFileClass text. And **subsection labels were splitting sections apart**, so the three categories landed in three different chunks and no single result could answer the question.

Chunks now carry their real class, contents pages rank below prose, headings read `ASCIIFileClass > GetLastLineNo`, and a section stays whole. Property references in the Language Reference (`PROP:NumTabs` and the rest) get their own headings too, so the definition outranks a passing mention in an example.

Verified against a fixed set of eight retrieval tests, kept with the code at [`ClarionAssistant/docs/DocGraph-Chunking-Verification.md`](ClarionAssistant/docs/DocGraph-Chunking-Verification.md), including a guard on the date-picture table above so a future chunking change cannot quietly undo the extraction fix.

Index-noise suppression currently covers documentation whose contents pages put the title and page number on one line &mdash; SoftVelocity's and CapeSoft's. BoxSoft's manuals wrap them across two lines and are not yet recognised.

### Spot which libraries need re-importing

The Documentation Graph panel (Settings &rarr; Data &rarr; Info) gains a **Type** column showing each library's source format, and every column header &mdash; Library, Type, Vendor, Chunks &mdash; is now a sort toggle. Click **Type** to group the PDFs together, which is the fastest way to see what wants a re-import after this release.

### The installer remembers where your Clarion actually is (#142)

Setup derived each Clarion path fresh on every run, registry first, and discarded whatever you corrected in the wizard. If your Clarion isn't where SoftVelocity's installer registered it &mdash; a second copy, or one launched with `/Configdir=` against its own settings folder &mdash; you had to re-enter the path on every release, and forget once.

That failure is quiet: the addin lands in a tree you don't launch, the IDE keeps loading the old one, and the symptoms get reported against a build replaced weeks ago. Paths a run actually installs to are now remembered and offered next time, and validated on read so a tree that has since moved falls back to detection.

### Diagnostics stop reporting false corruption (#168)

Clarion source is saved as Windows-1252/ANSI with no BOM, but four `File.ReadAllText` calls on the LSP text-sync path read it with no encoding argument &mdash; and .NET only auto-detects via BOM. Every single-byte high-bit character (a copyright symbol, say) silently became `U+FFFD` *before* the text reached the language server, which then correctly flagged the replacement character it had been handed. The result was waves of "this character will corrupt the file" warnings &mdash; dozens per file &mdash; on files that are perfectly valid on disk. All four sites now read through `EncodingHelper.DetectFileEncoding`, the same helper the diff viewer got in #94.

### Squiggles stop vanishing (#170)

The squiggle overlay could render nothing at all for a file that the diagnostics pill correctly reported an error for moments later. Four defects, one symptom, all rooted in treating "no information yet" as "authoritatively zero": a premature empty LSP republish was trusted as final (the server publishes progressively, and a slower cross-file check can land in a later batch); a timed-out round-trip was folded into an empty marker list, which *erased* every existing squiggle and its gutter mark rather than merely failing to add one; the client's timeout sat below the host's own worst case, discarding slow-but-successful analyses; and the settle loop parked a thread-pool thread per request. Empty results now get a short settle window before being believed, a timeout leaves the rendered markers alone, the diagnostics call gets its own longer budget while completion and hover keep their short interactive one, and the wait is properly async.

### Diagnostics window follows the CA Editor's theme &mdash; and appears at all (#169)

The LSP status bar and the diagnostics popup rendered in the chat pane's theme, which is a separate setting from the CA Editor's own. They now follow the **active editor's** theme, tracked per Monaco surface rather than read from a process-wide mirror that only ever recorded whichever page spoke last.

Three correctness bugs surfaced in the same code path and are fixed here too. The status bar pill **never appeared** when the IDE's own ClarionLsp addin was the active client &mdash; the visibility check asked the bundled `LspClient`, which in that configuration is never started, so the pill was hidden on every tick and the window it opens was unreachable. Both the liveness check and the cache read now go through `SharedLspBridge`, and the target file is resolved from the active editor instead of "the last file any LSP tool touched". The pill also stopped claiming a green **OK** for files nothing had ever been published about &mdash; unknown now renders as its own muted state rather than being flattened into "clean" during exactly the window when results are still arriving, and the status bar **asks** for diagnostics when it finds none cached instead of reporting "unknown" indefinitely at a cache nothing else was going to fill. And severity colours now survive a live dark&#8646;light switch instead of keeping the previous theme's palette until the rows next rebuilt.

Rounding it out: owner-drawn column headers and grid lines that actually follow the theme, a selection highlight that no longer overrides each row's severity colour, a dark-mode-aware native title bar, and no more hover flicker.

### Completion stops leaking other procedures' locals (#172)

Follow-up to #159. The CodeGraph backfill in bare-prefix completion matched symbol names across the whole indexed solution with no scope awareness, so a variable declared **private to some unrelated procedure in a different file** was offered exactly like a genuine global &mdash; typing `Include` at the top of a PROGRAM file could surface an `IncludeAddress` local from elsewhere entirely. Symbols the indexer already tags as procedure-private are now filtered out of that merge. Locals in the procedure you're actually standing in are unaffected: those come from a live-buffer parse, not the database.

### `DO` completes routines, and only routines

`DO` takes a ROUTINE label and nothing else, so it is now its own completion context answered from routines alone. Routine names are read **from the live buffer**, scoped to the enclosing procedure &mdash; which is a routine's real visibility in Clarion &mdash; so a routine you just typed and haven't saved completes too. Previously `DO` was answered from the general symbol set: typing `DO ref` offered methods from an unrelated `Reflection` class while missing the `RefreshWindow` routine a few lines up.

### Ctrl+X in the CA Editor reaches the clipboard (#173)

Clarion-style Ctrl+X posted the cut text to the host before deleting it from the buffer &mdash; and the CA Editor never implemented its half of that contract, so **Ctrl+X deleted the line without putting anything on the Windows clipboard**. Both stubs left inert since the original overlay spike are now wired: the cut text reaches `Clipboard.SetText`, and a Data-pad field dropped directly onto the editor surface now returns activation to the editor's own tab instead of leaving focus stranded on the pad.

### Show the diagnostics bar again after dismissing it

The LSP status bar &mdash; the strip at the bottom of the assistant pane carrying the diagnostics pill &mdash; has always had its own **&#10005;**, and nothing brought it back: restarting Clarion was the only way. A **&#9678;** button joins the header's title-row actions, beside the theme toggle, and shows or hides it on demand. It repaints from the current state on the way back rather than returning with whatever it was showing when dismissed.

<!-- release-docs: covered=deploy -->
### Clarion 10 builds again

`DiffService` called a `FileService` method that doesn't exist on Clarion 10's older SharpDevelop fork, so the C10 build had been failing outright since the CA Compare write-back work landed &mdash; while 11, 11.1 and 12 compiled clean. It now reaches the same information through an API present on every fork, from one code path.

**If you run Clarion 10, this release is the first to include roughly a week of changes** that never made it into a working C10 binary. The installer ships a per-Clarion build (`bin\Debug-C10` and siblings), so a broken build for one release meant that release shipping stale or not at all.

The deploy script no longer lets one bad target take the others down with it, either: a build failure for a single Clarion version used to abort the run *before* the deploy step, so **nothing** was deployed anywhere while the console showed the other three building successfully. Failures are now collected, every version that built is deployed, and the run ends by naming what didn't ship.

<!-- release-docs: covered=create-class -->
### Class model preview renders again (#171)

In **Create New Class**, any model whose declaration put a Clarion keyword and a quoted string on the same line &mdash; a standard `CLASS,TYPE,MODULE('X.CLW'),LINK('X.CLW')` &mdash; rendered visibly broken markup instead of coloured code. The keyword pass ran over the HTML the string pass had just produced and matched the literal `class` and `string` inside its own attributes. The two passes are now ordered so there is no HTML for the keyword pass to collide with.

### Smart formatter keeps comments where they belong (#161)

Two fixes to **Ctrl+I**, both reported and diagnosed by [@geircodes](https://github.com/geircodes).

A comment sitting among declarations &mdash; inside a `GROUP`/`QUEUE`/`RECORD`/`FILE`, or directly in a procedure's or routine's DATA section &mdash; was indented to the CODE-section column rather than the field column it had been aligned to. It visibly jumped left while every declaration around it formatted correctly, which read as arbitrary rather than as a rule; comments inside `IF`/`CASE`/`LOOP` bodies were never affected, which is what made it look inconsistent. Those comments now line up with the fields they sit among &mdash; and a long banner comment does *not* drag the whole structure's field column to the right with it.

**"Indent comments" now means what it says.** Switching it off used to *delete* a comment's indentation and dump it at column 1, including comments hand-aligned deep inside nested control structures. Off now means leave the comment exactly where it is.

### Thanks

- **geircodes** &mdash; the bulk of this cycle again: the LSP source-encoding fix that ended a wave of false "this character will corrupt the file" warnings (#168), the squiggle overlay going blank on slow or premature results (#170), the diagnostics window's theme plus three correctness bugs found alongside it &mdash; including the status bar pill that never appeared at all (#169), the completion scope leak that surfaced other procedures' locals solution-wide (#172), the CA Editor clipboard and drop-focus stubs (#173), and the class-model preview highlighting (#171). Also reported, diagnosed and wrote the patch for the Ctrl+I comment-indenting fixes (#161), filing it as an issue with the semantics question open rather than as a PR &mdash; which is why "Indent comments OFF" now means something deliberate.
- **Bill Atchison** &mdash; reporting that PDFs would not import (#167). The bug was invisible to anyone whose machine happened to carry a stray `pdftotext.exe`, which is every developer machine here; without the report it would have kept shipping.
- **BoxSoft** &mdash; the installer path report (#142) that turned out to be the reason a whole diagnostic round was spent chasing symptoms in a build that had already been replaced.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

| Requirement | Notes |
|---|---|
| **Clarion IDE** (v10, v11, or v12) | Auto-detected from Windows registry |
| **Claude Code CLI** | [Download from Anthropic](https://claude.ai/download) |
| **WebView2 Runtime** | Pre-installed on Windows 11; [download for Windows 10](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/webview2/) |

### What leaves your machine

Clarion Assistant is a front end for the **Claude Code CLI**, and that CLI talks to Anthropic's API
over the internet. When you use the assistant, what you type and the file contents it reads on your
behalf &mdash; source, embed code, dictionary and schema details, build output &mdash; are sent to
Anthropic to produce a reply. The IDE tools described in this README are how the assistant reads
that context, so anything you point it at is potentially part of a request.

That is the product working as intended rather than a hidden behaviour, but it is your code, so it
should be stated plainly: **do not use it on material you are not permitted to send to a third-party
API.** Anthropic's terms and privacy policy govern what happens to it &mdash; see
[Anthropic Privacy](https://www.anthropic.com/legal/privacy). Your Claude Code account and its
settings, not this addin, control that relationship.

A few other features reach the network only when you explicitly invoke them: ingesting
documentation from a URL, GitHub operations, and the marketplace browser.

### Install

1. **[Download the latest installer](https://github.com/ClarionLive/ClarionAssistant/releases/latest)** (code-signed)
2. Close the Clarion IDE
3. Run the installer &mdash; select which Clarion versions to install for
4. Restart the Clarion IDE

**One row per Clarion version, and they are not interchangeable.** Each row installs the addin *built for that version*, compiled against that Clarion's own IDE assemblies &mdash; so pointing the "Clarion 10 folder" row at a Clarion 12 installation ships the wrong build and it won't load. The installer now checks the version of whatever folder you enter and warns you if it doesn't match the row.

**More than one installation of the same version?** That's supported &mdash; press the **`+`** button on that version's row and pick the extra folder. Each extra gets a copy of that row's addin once the install finishes, and the list is remembered for next time. Handy if you keep, say, two Clarion 12 trees side by side.

> One trap worth knowing: never leave a spare or backup copy of the addin folder anywhere *inside* an `accessory\addins` tree. Clarion scans subfolders, and a duplicate makes startup fail with *"Identity name used by multiple addins."* Keep backups outside.

### Configuring your Clarion path

The build uses `Directory.Build.props` at the repo root to locate your Clarion installation. The defaults assume John's machine layout (`C:\Clarion12`, `C:\Clarion11-13372`, `C:\Clarion10`).

If your Clarion is installed elsewhere, create a `Directory.Build.props.user` file alongside `Directory.Build.props` (it is gitignored — never commit it):

```xml
<Project>
  <!-- Replace with your actual Clarion installation path -->
  <PropertyGroup>
    <ClarionRoot>C:\Clarion\Clarion12</ClarionRoot>
  </PropertyGroup>
</Project>
```

The `.user` file overrides the defaults for all `ClarionVersion` values, so a single path entry is enough if you only build for one version. You can still pass `/p:ClarionVersion=11` on the command line to select the target version.

Alternatively, pass the path directly on the command line without creating a `.user` file:

```powershell
msbuild ClarionAssistant.csproj /p:ClarionVersion=11 /p:ClarionRoot="C:\Clarion\Clarion11.1"
```

### Build

```powershell
# Build for a specific version (uses Directory.Build.props.user if present)
cd ClarionAssistant
msbuild ClarionAssistant.csproj /p:Configuration=Debug /p:ClarionVersion=12

# Build the addin for all Clarion versions via deploy script
.\deploy.ps1 -NoBuild:$false -Version all
```

> **Note:** Use MSBuild directly — do **not** use `dotnet build`. WebView2 NuGet resolution fails with the .NET CLI on this .NET Framework 4.8 project.

### Deploy for Development

```powershell
# Deploy to your local Clarion IDE (builds + copies DLLs)
cd ClarionAssistant
.\deploy.ps1 -Version 12

# Deploy without rebuilding (e.g. HTML-only changes)
.\deploy.ps1 -Version 12 -NoBuild

# Kill the IDE before deploying (when DLLs are locked)
.\deploy.ps1 -Version 12 -Kill
```

### Running the tests

```powershell
cd ClarionAssistant
.\tests\Run-Tests.ps1
```

One entry point for both harness families: standalone `csc` harnesses over IDE-free service code
(`tests\`), and node harnesses over the Monaco WebView2 pages (`Terminal\test\`). Neither is wired into
MSBuild &mdash; they exist to be run before you deploy, because the bugs they catch (a NUL byte inside a
420 KB HTML file, a settings panel that reads fine in dark mode and is illegible in light) pass a clean
build and fail a human.

Most need nothing installed. One page test needs `jsdom`, declared as a devDependency:

```powershell
npm install --prefix Terminal\test
```

Without it that test reports *could not run* and fails the overall run rather than reporting green. See
[`tests/README.md`](ClarionAssistant/tests/README.md) for what each harness guards.
