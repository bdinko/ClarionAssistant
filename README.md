## What is Clarion Assistant?

Clarion Assistant is an IDE addin that brings AI-powered code intelligence to [Clarion](https://softvelocity.com) developers. It runs as a docked terminal pane inside the Clarion IDE, giving you a conversational coding assistant that understands your entire codebase.

Ask it to write Clarion code, explain procedures, refactor classes, build COM controls, convert Clarion apps to C#, or navigate your solution &mdash; all without leaving the IDE.

### Key Capabilities

- **Write and edit Clarion code** directly in the IDE editor
- **Multi-tab terminal** &mdash; multiple Claude Code sessions with independent workspaces
- **Language Server (LSP)** &mdash; real-time code intelligence with go-to-definition, find references, hover info, diagnostics, and rename support
- **CodeGraph** &mdash; solution-wide code intelligence via SQL queries over every symbol, relationship, and call chain
- **DocGraph** &mdash; instant search across 14,000+ indexed documentation chunks (Clarion core, CapeSoft, Icetips, and more)
- **SchemaGraph** &mdash; database schema intelligence from Clarion dictionaries, SQL Server, SQLite, and PostgreSQL
- **Source Control** &mdash; GitHub and Bitbucket integration with per-solution repo linking
- **Build tools** &mdash; build solutions, individual apps, or C# COM controls without leaving the chat
- **Class intelligence** &mdash; parse CLASS definitions, sync .inc/.clw, generate method stubs
- **Application tree** &mdash; open .app files, list procedures, navigate the embeditor
- **Monaco source editor** &mdash; the default editor for Clarion `.clw`/`.inc` source: syntax highlighting, folding, F12/Ctrl+Click go-to-definition, inline diagnostics, and completion (toggleable under Options &rarr; Clarion Assistant &rarr; Editor Surfaces)
- **Smart Formatter (Ctrl+I)** &mdash; reformats Clarion code with structure indentation and aligned declarations; configurable
- **CA Embeditor** &mdash; use Clarion's own **Embeditor Source** (right-click a procedure, or the Views toolbar button) and a fast Monaco/WebView2 editor overlays the native embeditor automatically; edits save straight back with Clarion-native Save &amp; Exit
- **Embed navigation (Ctrl+J / Ctrl+B)** &mdash; jump to the next/previous *filled* embed, the same keys the native Clarion embeditor uses (#185); the toolbar arrows and an unfiltered walk over every embed are there too, and all of it is rebindable
- **Code Snippets (Ctrl+Shift+J)** &mdash; classic Clarion template-picker parity: insert reusable code with tab-stops and a `${SELECTED}` placeholder, managed from Settings &rarr; Snippets
- **CA Explorer** &mdash; docked pad showing the CA Embeditor's open procedure: its Local, Module &amp; Global Data, Declared Tables, Other Files, and their Keys, Columns, and Relations; drag a field to the editor or Window designer, copy/paste variables native-style, and a Cheat Sheet tab of editor shortcuts
- **Evaluate Code** &mdash; interactive code review for entire apps, procedures, open files, or selected code
- **CA Find & Replace** &mdash; dockable Find pad or classic in-editor overlay (your pick), Find-All with results in their own editor tab, and one shared history across every CA surface
- **Document Structure** &mdash; fly-out outline of the current buffer with symbol icons, Class &#9656; Methods regrouping, and filtering; click to navigate
- **Diff viewer** &mdash; Monaco-based side-by-side diffs with syntax highlighting, live-buffer diffing, and a current-line comparison panel
- **Knowledge system** &mdash; persistent cross-session memory for decisions, patterns, and gotchas
- **Zoom persistence** &mdash; Ctrl+mousewheel zoom is saved and restored across sessions

## What's New (Unreleased)

<!-- Entries for the next release go here, in the same shape as the release blocks below. -->

## What's New in v6.0

6.0 is a major release. Claude's editor and embed tools now work on the text you see in the CA Editor and CA Embeditor, the bundled language server moves to v1.0.8 with incremental sync, hover, completion and diagnostics are more accurate, and the CA Editor gains keymap profiles. Full notes: **[docs/releases/v6.0.0.md](docs/releases/v6.0.0.md)**.

### MultiTerminal messages reach IDE terminals again

MultiTerminal has retired its "channels" for delivering messages into a Claude Code session and now writes into the session directly. Clarion Assistant only loaded the MultiTerminal plugin when the channel server was present, so once MultiTerminal removed it, every IDE terminal launched without the plugin: nothing could message it, and it could only find its messages by polling. IDE terminals now load the plugin again, and no longer pass the development-channels flag or answer its warning prompt. Messages arrive in the session without polling once your MultiTerminal includes native delivery for IDE terminals.

IDE terminals now have short, numbered MultiTerminal names: **CA1**, **CA2** and so on, instead of `CA-Terminal-2-CC`. Each launch takes the lowest number that is free across this IDE's tabs and MultiTerminal's live roster, so two IDEs get CA1 and CA2 rather than two names that differ only by a `-2` suffix. The tab shows the same name the roster does, keeping any context it was opened with (`CA2 · MySolution`), and the number is released when the assistant in that tab exits.

Each terminal is also told its own name, and keeps it through `/clear`. Before this, with a Clarion Assistant chat open in two IDEs, a terminal that received a message could not tell which of the similar names on the roster was its own, so it could not reliably reply. And closing a tab no longer removes it from MultiTerminal by name, which could drop a same-named tab in another IDE off MultiTerminal's list. With the MultiTerminal update above, MultiTerminal retires a closed tab itself.

### Unsupported Windows is reported, not a blank terminal, and the installer refuses it ([#236](https://github.com/ClarionLive/ClarionAssistant/issues/236))

Clarion Assistant's terminals need Windows 10 version 1809 or Windows Server 2019, or later: they run on the Windows ConPTY API, which first shipped in that release, and Claude Code has the same minimum. On older Windows, such as Server 2016, a tab used to open empty with no explanation. It now says which Windows build it found and what it needs. Any other failure to start the assistant is shown in the tab too, instead of leaving it blank. The installer now checks the Windows version before installing.

### UltimateCOM: COM controls on different threads no longer crash the app ([#235](https://github.com/ClarionLive/ClarionAssistant/issues/235))

The UltimateCOM class that Clarion Assistant installs into `accessory\libsrc\win` kept one event queue for the whole program but locked it per control, so two COM controls on different threads (for example one on the main frame and one in an MDI child) could raise events at the same moment and free each other's event data, which crashed with an access violation in `WindowManager.Ask`. The queue now has a single shared lock, and each control's thread only ever sees and removes its own events. `UltimateCOM.inc` is unchanged, so existing apps and templates need nothing but a recompile.

<!-- release-docs: covered=editor,embeditor -->
### Large procedures: the CA editors warn before Clarion runs out of memory, and say why when they can't start

Clarion is a 32-bit program with 2 GB of address space, and a big solution fills most of it. Opening a very large procedure (a 3.2 MB generated module, for example) needs a few hundred MB in one piece, and when that is not there Clarion itself fails with an out-of-memory error inside its own embeditor. Three changes:

- **A warning before it happens.** When the largest free block of Clarion's memory drops below 48 MB, a small notice at the bottom right of the IDE says so and suggests saving and restarting. It never takes focus and closes itself when memory recovers. The threshold can be changed by putting a number of MB in `%LOCALAPPDATA%\ClarionAssistant\mem-watch-warn-mb.txt`.
- **No more silent fallback.** If the CA Embeditor or CA Editor cannot start, it now steps aside so Clarion's own editor is usable, and a notice says why. Before, you were left in the native editor with no explanation.
- **Memory is given back.** Closing a CA editor on a big procedure or file now returns its memory to Clarion (about 230 MB on the 3.2 MB test procedure), where before it stayed in use until Clarion restarted. When there is plenty of room this step is skipped, so it costs nothing.

These checks also understand a `Clarion.exe` that has been marked **LargeAddressAware** (4 GB of address space instead of 2 GB), so they see the full 4 GB and do not warn falsely. On the 3.2 MB test procedure, that flag took the largest free block with the procedure open from 39 MB to over 1.5 GB.

<!-- release-docs: covered=embeditor,lsp,memory -->
### Opening a large procedure in the CA Embeditor uses far less memory

Measured on a 3.2 MB generated procedure, where every large block of memory counts in 32-bit Clarion:

- **The Data pad no longer keeps a copy of the whole application.** Each open exported the entire app (20 MB on the test app) and kept it as one 38 MB block of text, then re-read the whole thing on every refresh. It now reads the export once, line by line, and keeps only the data sections the pad shows, about 7% of it. The pad shows exactly the same Local Data, Global Data, Other Files and browse file as before; this was checked against all 367 procedures of the test app.
- **No more whole-procedure copies on every open.** Two steps split the entire procedure into lines on every open, about 65 MB in total. One now happens only when you click an Errors-pane row, and the other copies just the embed sections.
- **Sending the procedure to the language server costs almost nothing.** Every open, and every pause while typing, turned the whole procedure into one 34 MB message in memory before sending it. It is now written to the language server piece by piece, at about 0.05 MB.

<!-- release-docs: covered=embeditor -->
### CA Embeditor hovers are as fast and as accurate as the CA Editor's

In a large procedure, hovering a global such as `GlobalRequest` in the CA Embeditor could sit on "Loading" for seconds, and a procedure call such as `PASSWORD(...)` was described as the ENTRY attribute of the same name. The CA Editor, on the same code, answered both instantly. The embeditor's quick lookups need the project's CodeGraph database, which is found from the procedure's generated module, and the embeditor often could not locate that module: it lives in the folder the redirection file names (for example `.\Source`), and the redirection file was only loaded once the Clarion Assistant chat panel had opened. The embeditor now loads the redirection file for the IDE's Clarion version itself, and falls back to the open solution's folder when the module still can't be found, so hovers answer immediately either way.

<!-- release-docs: covered=lsp,embeditor,red,data-pad -->
### Build > Set Clarion Version takes effect with no chat panel open

Switching versions with Build > Set Clarion Version only reached the language server and the redirection file when the Clarion Assistant chat panel was open. Without it, the language server went on resolving through the old version's redirection file and libraries until the IDE was restarted. The addin now follows the IDE's version from startup: on a switch it reloads the redirection file and restarts the language server on the new version, whether or not a chat tab exists.

If the new version's redirection file can't be read (missing, or held open by another program), Clarion Assistant no longer goes on quietly using the previous version's. It stops using a redirection file until the right one loads, and it retries every 30 seconds, so it recovers by itself once the file is readable. The Data pad's redirection-file header follows the switch too, on every tab.

<!-- release-docs: covered=mcp,editor,embeditor -->
### Claude now edits what you see in the CA Editor and CA Embeditor

With a file open in the CA Editor, or a procedure open in the CA Embeditor, Claude's editor and embed tools used to read and write the native Clarion document hidden underneath it. You saw no change, and saving from the CA editor then threw Claude's edits away; `save_file` saved the hidden copy, without your own unsaved edits. The tools now work on the text in front of you:

- **Reads include your unsaved edits**, and **Claude's edits appear at once**, each as one undo step. `undo` and `redo` use the CA editor's own undo history.
- **Saving is the CA editor's own save.** `save_file` and `save_and_close_embeditor` do exactly what your Save button does.
- **Nothing falls through to the hidden document.** If the CA editor is still loading or doesn't answer, the tool returns an error and changes nothing. Tools that would discard your work &mdash; `cancel_embeditor`, `close_file` with unsaved changes, `apply_embed_edits` &mdash; refuse and leave it to you.
- **`open_file` waits until the file is really in front.** It used to report "Opened" while the previous tab stayed active, so the next edit could land in the wrong file. It now returns only once the file is the active editor, including a tab that is already open behind the `.app` view, and returns an error otherwise. `get_open_files` lists full paths.
- **Every edit says where it landed**, naming the file and line (and, in the CA Embeditor, the procedure and embed slot). The edit tools take an optional `file_path` and refuse, changing nothing, if a different file is active. In the CA Embeditor `file_path` can name the app, the procedure's module or the procedure itself.
- **Embed source shows real line numbers.** Each code line of `get_embeditor_source` / `search_embeditor_source` carries the buffer line number that `get_line_text`, `replace_range` and `go_to_line` use.
- **Undoing back to the saved text reads as unmodified** again, in the tab marker, `is_modified` and `get_open_files`.
- **`open_procedure_embed` opens the procedure you asked for.** Asked for `CheckComma`, it could open `VerifyInventoryFiles`: it typed the name into the app tree's search and opened whatever row was selected. It now checks the name is an exact procedure of the app, checks the selection before opening and the procedure after, and cancels without saving if the wrong one opened. It also works with a CA Editor tab in front of the app tree.

<!-- release-docs: covered=embeditor -->
### CA Embeditor: a save that can't go through no longer loses your text

A CA Embeditor save matched embed slots to the procedure by line number. After any multi-line change elsewhere in the procedure the numbers no longer agreed, and the save cancelled the embed: the text was gone. Closing with Ctrl+F4 had a second route to the same loss. Slots are now matched by the generated code around them, so line shifts don't matter. A save that genuinely can't be done leaves the CA Embeditor open with your edits and says why. A second save while one is running (Ctrl+S, Ctrl+Q, or Claude's save) is refused with *"A save is already in progress"* instead of racing the first, and Ctrl+Q never closes on lost edits.

<!-- release-docs: covered=lsp,diagnostics -->
### `lsp_diagnostics` checks the text in your editor, and says how far it got

- **It checks what you are editing.** It used to check the file on disk, never the edit just made, and could not check an embed edit at all, since that only reaches the module `.clw` at the next generate. It now checks the open editor's text &mdash; the embeditor of that module, a CA Editor tab or a CA Embeditor file tab &mdash; and the disk only when the file isn't open. The answer's `analysed` field says which it used, and `source: "disk"` checks the saved file on purpose.
- **A slow analysis returns what it has.** On a 62,000-line generated module the complete answer takes about 17 seconds, so the 3-second default always came back empty-handed. When time runs out it now returns the problems found so far, flagged `partial`, and a new `timeout_ms` lets you wait longer (up to 120 seconds).
- **The first call of a session no longer reports a partial answer as complete** (165 problems instead of 437 on the test module).
- **A repeated call no longer waits its whole timeout for nothing.** It re-sent text the language server already had; the server ignores identical text, so the call could never be answered.
- **A fresh standalone server no longer reads "pending" for up to a minute** when it can't work out a Clarion version: it now always tells the language server which solution is open.
- **Fewer false "not declared" squiggles.** Globals the language server reported as undeclared were already filtered out of the tool's answer, but the CA Editor's squiggles and the language-server status count read the unfiltered list and showed them anyway. And in a template-generated PROGRAM, whose CLASS prototypes sit in column 1, every global FILE label stayed flagged because the filter stopped reading at the first prototype.

<!-- release-docs: covered=lsp -->
### The bundled language server is now v1.0.8 ([#253](https://github.com/ClarionLive/ClarionAssistant/issues/253))

Re-pinned from v1.0.5 straight to v1.0.8, skipping v1.0.6 (which could parse a stale copy after an edit) on Mark Sarson's advice. v1.0.8 brings diagnostics about three times faster, and answers hover, completion and go-to-definition ahead of its background validation. The installer ships the same version.

<!-- release-docs: covered=lsp -->
### Typing in a large module no longer sends the whole file to the language server ([PR #252](https://github.com/ClarionLive/ClarionAssistant/pull/252))

Every edit used to go to the language server as the entire buffer. It now goes as the one changed range. On a 61,000-line generated module, sending a change dropped from about 1.4 seconds (6 seconds at worst) to about 21 ms, and the slowest hover just after an edit from 7.3 seconds to under 1.5. Measured with Mark Sarson's new HoverBench ([PR #251](https://github.com/ClarionLive/ClarionAssistant/pull/251), [PR #254](https://github.com/ClarionLive/ClarionAssistant/pull/254)), which times the CA editors' own hover layer against any language server build on your own solution.

<!-- release-docs: covered=hover,local-scope -->
### Hover: the language server's card answers where it says more ([#250](https://github.com/ClarionLive/ClarionAssistant/issues/250), [PR #255](https://github.com/ClarionLive/ClarionAssistant/pull/255), [PR #256](https://github.com/ClarionLive/ClarionAssistant/pull/256))

The CA Editor and CA Embeditor answer most hovers instantly from their own index. For some words that quick card was hiding a better one:

- **`END`, `ELSE`, `OF` and the other structure keywords** show the language server's cards again (*"closes CASE"*, *"branch 2 of 3"*), a regression in 5.9.0 ([#250](https://github.com/ClarionLive/ClarionAssistant/issues/250)).
- **Module data, and GROUP, QUEUE, CLASS and INTERFACE declarations,** show the server's card, with the real scope (not a hard-coded "local"), the field count, and a clickable file-and-line link ([PR #255](https://github.com/ClarionLive/ClarionAssistant/pull/255)).
- In each case the quick card still appears when the server has nothing, is down, or takes longer than 300 ms. One card either way.
- **A keyword in a declaration is no longer taken for a symbol.** Hovering `TEXT` on a WINDOW's control line showed an unrelated library equate called `Text`. Keywords in a declaration's keyword slot now get their keyword card, and the index only offers an equate from an `.inc` or `.equ` file the module can actually see. Index cards' locations are clickable links too ([PR #256](https://github.com/ClarionLive/ClarionAssistant/pull/256)).
- **Procedures are labelled by where they are declared.** Every procedure used to be called a "local procedure". Hover and completion now say *global procedure* (the PROGRAM's MAP), *module procedure* (a MEMBER module's MAP), *local procedure of &lt;Owner&gt;* (a MAP inside a procedure), or just *procedure* when the prototype is elsewhere.

<!-- release-docs: covered=completion,embeditor,codegraph -->
### Completion: colon names, GROUP fields and include-file equates

- **Typing `:` after a name opens the list again** (`glo:`, `PROP:`, `EVENT:`). The list closed on the colon and nothing came back until Ctrl+Space. And when the language server's items arrive after the editor has already shown an empty list, the list now reopens with them.
- **GROUP and QUEUE fields are listed once after a dot**, not once with their type and once without ([PR #238](https://github.com/ClarionLive/ClarionAssistant/pull/238)).
- **Colon-qualified completion keeps the language server's items** ([PR #241](https://github.com/ClarionLive/ClarionAssistant/pull/241)). They were dropped as soon as CodeGraph found a single match of its own, so a global declared in a header the PROGRAM includes never appeared, although hover found it. A dictionary field both sources know is listed once, with the dictionary's type.
- **Equates declared at file level in an `.inc`** are offered in the files that include it, directly or through the PROGRAM ([PR #243](https://github.com/ClarionLive/ClarionAssistant/pull/243)). Equates from `.inc` files the current file can't see are left out, so short prefixes aren't flooded. They are picked up the next time the solution is indexed; `winerr.inc`'s equates are no longer indexed twice.

<!-- release-docs: covered=editor -->
### CA Editor: keymap profiles, and every editor key in one table ([#206](https://github.com/ClarionLive/ClarionAssistant/issues/206), [PR #249](https://github.com/ClarionLive/ClarionAssistant/pull/249))

The Keyboard section of the editor settings (gear panel) now covers the whole keyboard:

- **Keymap profiles:** Clarion (the default, unchanged), VS Code, Visual Studio and Notepad++. Your own key changes sit on top of the profile.
- **Every key in one table.** The editor's own actions are listed beside the Clarion commands with all their keys, including two-key chords such as `Ctrl+K Ctrl+C`. The table opens on the Clarion commands; **All / Editor / Changed / Clashes** and a search box show the rest.
- **Clashes are shown.** A Clarion command that takes a key from an editor action now says so on both rows; before, the action just stopped working.
- **Core editing keys are protected.** Nothing can be moved onto undo, cut/copy/paste, select all, plain typing keys or word movement. Switching profile names the keys it reset, and switching back restores them.
- **Two-key chords work in every profile.** In Visual Studio's, `Ctrl+K Ctrl+U` no longer stops at Lowercase on `Ctrl+U`.

<!-- release-docs: covered=editor,outline -->
### CA Editor: your tab comes back, and Document structure opens where you want it

- **Reopening a solution re-selects the tab you were on** ([PR #237](https://github.com/ClarionLive/ClarionAssistant/pull/237)). The IDE restores the open files but always left the last one in the list active.
- **The Document structure pane can open at a chosen level** ([PR #242](https://github.com/ClarionLive/ClarionAssistant/pull/242)): All (as before), or 1 to 4 levels, optionally sorted A&ndash;Z at that level only &mdash; for example, each class's method names sorted, and the classes left in source order. Both settings are in the editor settings.
- **No false "could not start" notice** when a CA Editor tab is closed (for example by closing the solution) while it is still starting.

<!-- release-docs: covered=version,mcp-server -->
### The right Clarion, when more than one is installed ([#247](https://github.com/ClarionLive/ClarionAssistant/issues/247), [PR #248](https://github.com/ClarionLive/ClarionAssistant/pull/248))

In [#247](https://github.com/ClarionLive/ClarionAssistant/issues/247) CodeGraph indexed none of a project's 94 files. The standalone server picked which `ClarionProperties.xml` to read from its own version number, found no such settings folder, and read the newest one: another Clarion's. And every Clarion install also registers a Clarion.NET compiler on the same folders, so a machine whose settings list it first was handed the .NET redirection file and libraries.

- **The standalone server now reads the settings of the Clarion it is installed in**, found from that install's `Clarion.exe`, and never guesses from the newest settings folder.
- **A Win32 Clarion is never given the Clarion.NET entry's redirection file.**
- **A version named explicitly reads that version's own settings**, not the host Clarion's copy, which goes stale whenever the other IDE saves (part of [#244](https://github.com/ClarionLive/ClarionAssistant/issues/244)).
- **A solution follows the IDE's own choice of Clarion for it.** A Clarion 10 solution browsed in the Clarion 12 IDE was resolved against Clarion 12 by `lsp_diagnostics`, `resolve_red_path` and `get_solution_info`, so its includes "could not be found".

<!-- release-docs: covered=dashboard,projects,tabs,header -->
### Home: COM controls and IDE addins get their own tabs

- **COM controls and IDE addins each have a tab**, opened from two new Dashboard cards that show how many you have. The Dashboard's old "Clarion COM and Addin Projects" table was read as "make a project per Clarion app"; working with your open solution needs no setup, and the Dashboard now says so.
- **The tab strip is always there, with Home first**, instead of appearing with the first opened tab and vanishing with the last.
- **SOLUTION follows the IDE.** It is read-only, like VERSION, and shows the solution's name, with the full path on hover and on the copy button. Switching solution in the IDE now does what the old dropdown did: releases the previous solution's databases and indexes the new one in the background.
- **Opening a project whose folder doesn't exist yet** offers to create it, instead of a "Project folder not found" box.

<!-- release-docs: covered=header -->
### The header panes size to their content ([#234](https://github.com/ClarionLive/ClarionAssistant/issues/234))

The Solution, Source Control and Schema Sources header panes size to their content instead of clipping it at larger text scaling.

<!-- release-docs: covered=codegraph -->
### CodeGraph indexes CLASS labels that contain a colon (part of [#246](https://github.com/ClarionLive/ClarionAssistant/issues/246))

A CLASS whose label contains a colon was not indexed, so calls through it could not be linked to its methods.

<!-- release-docs: covered=skills -->
### The Clarion skill's guidance is corrected and compile-checked ([PR #239](https://github.com/ClarionLive/ClarionAssistant/pull/239), [PR #240](https://github.com/ClarionLive/ClarionAssistant/pull/240))

The bundled `clarion` skill's guidance on CRLF line endings, MEMBER, DECIMAL return values and TXA embeds is corrected, each point reproduced with a standalone compile against Clarion 12. A new pitfalls reference lists rules verified the same way, and plausible-sounding rules that are false, so they don't creep back in. Following the same method: a missing `,PROC` is a warning (*"Calling function as procedure"*), not a compile error; redeclaring a PROGRAM global as `EXTERNAL` in a MEMBER fails at link time; and in a TXA each embed entry has its own `[END]` count, with one `[EMBED]` wrapping all of a procedure's embeds.

<!-- release-docs: covered=safety-hook -->
### The plugin's safety hook asks about a kill only when one is run

The Clarion Assistant plugin's safety hook asked for confirmation whenever `kill`, `taskkill` or `Stop-Process` appeared anywhere in a command, even in a search for the word. A hook's question overrides bypass mode, so an agent could sit on that prompt until someone answered it. It now asks only when a kill command is actually run: at the start of a command, after a separator or `then`/`do`, after `find -exec`, or behind `sudo`, `timeout`, `xargs` and the like. Quoted text and heredocs count as data only when they are read cleanly to their end, so anything ambiguous still asks. `pkill`, `killall`, `kill-port` and `fkill` are now caught too. Text handed to another shell or language (`powershell -Command`, `bash -c`, `node -e`, `python -c`) is still checked word by word, as before.

## What's New in v5.9

**Why 5.9.0 and not 5.8.2.** Clarion Assistant is joining the **Clarion Addin Registry**, so it can be found and updated from **AddinFinder** inside the IDE. That required our version number to become a single value that the addin manifest, the installer and the git tag all agree on &mdash; and it could not be 5.8.2. See the versioning entry below.

<!-- release-docs: covered=mcp,mcp-server,codegraph -->
### Clarion Assistant's tools now run without the Clarion IDE

There is a new **`clarion-mcp-server`**: the editor-agnostic half of Clarion Assistant, as a standalone program that speaks **MCP over stdio**. Point any MCP client at it &mdash; Claude Code in **Sublime Text**, in **VS Code**, or in a plain terminal &mdash; and you get Clarion intelligence in an editor that is not the IDE. This is for Clarion developers who hand-code and would rather not work in the Clarion IDE at all.

```
clarion-mcp-server --stdio --solution C:\Path\To\Your.sln
```

It serves **61 of the 118 tools**: the documentation search across SoftVelocity and every third-party vendor you have installed, the knowledge base, the LSP tools, the dictionary and SQL schema tools, CodeGraph indexing and queries, file and Everything search, and Clarion class analysis. Indexing works fully &mdash; it reads your `.red` redirection file the way the compiler does, so a solution with one hand-written source file still indexes the ABC library behind it.

The other **57 are withheld on purpose**, because they drive the IDE itself: opening files in the editor, the app tree, the embeditor, the designer. An MCP client reads the tool list as a promise about what it can do, so a tool that could only ever fail is worse than one that is honestly absent. The addin is unchanged and still offers all 118.

**Both can be running at once.** If your IDE and a standalone server both index the same solution, they no longer collide: a full re-index wipes the database before rebuilding it, so two overlapping runs used to be able to destroy each other's work and leave a graph pointing at code that had been deleted from it. Whichever starts second is now turned away, and told which process holds the database. A run whose process is killed &mdash; a deploy, a crash, Task Manager &mdash; releases immediately and leaves nothing stale behind.

<!-- release-docs: covered=mcp,schemagraph -->
### The assistant now knows which dictionary your app uses ([#210](https://github.com/ClarionLive/ClarionAssistant/issues/210))

Ask *"compare the table definition for ITEM and ITEMSERVICE"* and the assistant used to go looking &mdash; through old SQL scripts, then through whatever `.dctx` it could find on disk, which for the reporter was a stale one from a different project. It had no better option: **nothing told it which dictionary the open app is bound to**, and the schema tools picked their database by scanning the solution folder and taking the first `.schemagraph.db` the filesystem listed. Unordered, silent, and wrong often enough.

Two things change. **`get_app_info` now returns the dictionary path** straight from the app's Global Properties, and a new **`get_app_dictionary`** reads that dictionary *live* from the IDE &mdash; tables, prefixes, drivers, and per table its fields, keys and relationships &mdash; with no export and no ingest, so it can never be stale. The comparison above is now one call. The SchemaGraph tools look at the open app's own dictionary database first, and **every schema answer now says which database it came from and why it was chosen**, so a wrong pick is visible instead of confidently wrong.

<!-- release-docs: covered=lsp -->
### The bundled language server now actually starts

If you run Clarion Assistant **without** Mark Sarson's ClarionLsp addin, the bundled language server has never worked &mdash; every `lsp_` tool failed with the server unreachable. The cause was three bytes: .NET builds the pipe to a child process from the console's encoding and flushes that encoding's byte-order mark as it does so, and those three bytes arrived ahead of our first message. The server rejected the message and blamed its header, which was perfectly correct, so the real culprit sat one step upstream of everything the error pointed at. It has been masked all this time because ClarionLive users generally *do* have ClarionLsp installed, and Clarion Assistant hands LSP work to it when it is there.

Go-to-definition, find-references, hover, document symbols and diagnostics now work with nothing installed but Clarion itself.

<!-- release-docs: covered=skills -->
### The Clarion skills are a fifth of the size, and lose nothing

The nine largest skills have been rewritten: **313,000 characters down to 61,000**, roughly **78,000 tokens down to about 15,000** across the set. A session only ever loads each skill's short name and description up front; a skill's full body is read when the skill is actually used. So the saving shows up when a skill fires &mdash; a COM-control or embeditor task no longer pulls tens of thousands of tokens of instructions into the conversation before any work starts. ([#212](https://github.com/ClarionLive/ClarionAssistant/issues/212) &mdash; an earlier version of this note said skills load in full into every session, which was wrong.)

Nothing was deleted. The detail moved into 52 `references/` files that a skill reads *only when it actually needs them*, so invoking one now costs around 1,500&ndash;2,000 tokens plus whatever it genuinely reads, instead of the whole skill at once.

While rewriting them we also corrected the target framework. A find-and-replace had at some point turned every "net472 or net48" into "net48 or net48", which quietly made `net48` look like the only supported answer across seven files; the real COM controls target **net472**, and the skills now say so.

### CA Embeditor: the keys that used to do nothing now reach the IDE ([#192](https://github.com/ClarionLive/ClarionAssistant/issues/192))

Inside a CA Embeditor the editor swallowed most of Clarion's own shortcuts. **Ctrl+F4** (close), **Ctrl+O** (open) and **Alt+&lt;letter&gt;** now reach the IDE, the last of these by matching the letter against the real menu mnemonics rather than a hardcoded list &mdash; so it keeps working if the menus change. Keys are routed through the workbench menu itself, which means the IDE does what it would normally do rather than us reimplementing it.

### CA Embeditor: Ctrl+F4 on unsaved work now asks, because Clarion asks

Closing a dirty embeditor with Ctrl+F4 discarded the edits **silently**. The CA Editor prompted and the embeditor did not, which made it look arbitrary. The prompt was never broken: Clarion raises *"Save Changes in Embed Editor?"* by consulting the **native** editor's dirty flag, and our overlay never set it, so Clarion saw a clean embed and closed. We now flush the Monaco edits into the native embed and set that flag *before* the close is dispatched, so **Clarion raises its own dialog** &mdash; exact parity by construction, nothing imitated. Answering **Yes** saves the edits you can see rather than the stale native buffer underneath, which would have been a quieter and worse bug than the missing prompt. The toolbar's **red X** asks too, matched word for word to Clarion's dialog, and answering **Cancel** leaves you editing with your work still protected.

### CA Embeditor: an orphaned overlay is now torn down for real

When the native embed closed underneath the overlay &mdash; Errors-pane navigation opening the module source, a native cancel, an app-gen regeneration &mdash; the overlay kept its text and still looked healthy, while Save reported *"nothing to save"* and Cancel blanked the buffer. A teardown hook existed for exactly this and had **never once fired**: it subscribed to a `Disposed` event that does not exist on that class in this Clarion fork, and the null check meant to guard the subscription swallowed the failure, so the safety net read as present in the source while being connected to nothing.

### Ctrl+Q now shows Clarion's own confirmation, not ours ([#193](https://github.com/ClarionLive/ClarionAssistant/issues/193))

The Ctrl+Q confirmation was a web-styled dialog that looked nothing like the rest of the IDE. It is now the **native Windows dialog**, and it is scoped to the embeditor rather than firing globally.

<!-- release-docs: covered=claude,encoding -->
### New Chat no longer overwrites your CLAUDE.md ([#227](https://github.com/ClarionLive/ClarionAssistant/issues/227))

Opening a **New Chat** with no working directory set started the terminal in your user profile, and Clarion Assistant then copied its own instructions over `<working folder>\.claude\CLAUDE.md` on every launch &mdash; which there meant your **global** `%USERPROFILE%\.claude\CLAUDE.md`. The same code overwrote a hand-written project `CLAUDE.md`, and replaced `settings.local.json` wholesale, which is where Claude Code keeps your "don't ask again" permissions.

Clarion Assistant now **never writes into your user Claude folder** (`%USERPROFILE%\.claude`, or `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` if set) &mdash; not `CLAUDE.md`, not `settings.local.json`. In a project it only refreshes a `CLAUDE.md` that begins with its own opening lines, and only creates `settings.local.json` or replaces the one-line file it wrote itself. Where it can't write the file, it hands its instructions to Claude on the command line instead, so every terminal still gets them. **If you were hit by this, your original global `CLAUDE.md` is not restored automatically** &mdash; restore it from File History, OneDrive or another backup; the [#227 thread](https://github.com/ClarionLive/ClarionAssistant/issues/227) lists the places to look.

Related, and older: the Clarion Assistant **status line has never worked**. Its `settings.local.json` was written with a UTF-8 byte-order mark, and Claude Code parses that file with `JSON.parse`, which rejects a BOM &mdash; so the whole file was ignored. Every file we write for a non-.NET reader is now BOM-free, and a build guard fails the deploy if one ever regresses.

<!-- release-docs: covered=encoding -->
### Clarion source stays in its own encoding ([#203](https://github.com/ClarionLive/ClarionAssistant/issues/203))

The `write_file` tool wrote every `.clw` / `.inc` back as **UTF-8**, whatever it was before. An `ø` stored in an ANSI file as one byte came back as two, and Clarion shows that as `Ã¸` &mdash; in the editor, and in every string literal the compiler bakes into your program. `append_to_file` appended UTF-8 onto ANSI files, leaving one file in two encodings, and creating a class from a model, generating a `.clw` from an `.inc`, appending method stubs and the structure designer all did the same.

All of them now write Clarion source in **the file's own encoding**: an ANSI file stays ANSI, a genuinely UTF-8 file (one with a BOM, or already holding UTF-8 characters) stays UTF-8, and new or all-ASCII source files use Windows' ANSI code page, the one the Clarion IDE uses. A character the file's code page cannot hold &mdash; an emoji, say &mdash; is **refused with an error** naming it, and the file is left untouched, rather than silently becoming `?`. Files already converted won't convert themselves back; restore them from version control or re-save them as ANSI.

<!-- release-docs: covered=lsp -->
### The bundled language server is now v1.0.5 ([#224](https://github.com/ClarionLive/ClarionAssistant/issues/224))

The server that ships with Clarion Assistant moves from v1.0.2 to **v1.0.5**, synced through a hardened `Sync-LspServer.ps1 -Pure` that now verifies the shipped server matches the pin ([PR #186](https://github.com/ClarionLive/ClarionAssistant/pull/186)). Along the way we found the installer had kept packaging **v1.0.0** since the v1.0.2 re-pin in September; no release carried that (5.8.x shipped 1.0.0 with a matching manifest), but 5.9.0 would have. The installer now takes its server from the same pin as everything else.

<!-- release-docs: covered=folding -->
### Folding understands a LOOP closed by UNTIL or WHILE ([#222](https://github.com/ClarionLive/ClarionAssistant/issues/222))

A `LOOP` terminated by `UNTIL` or `WHILE` &mdash; valid Clarion, and the Language Reference's own example &mdash; never closed its fold, so it swallowed everything after it. The CA Editor and Embeditor now ask the language server for fold ranges ([PR #223](https://github.com/ClarionLive/ClarionAssistant/pull/223)), and the editor's own fallback, used while the server is starting or slow, closes a LOOP on `UNTIL` / `WHILE` too. A name like `While:Count` is not mistaken for a terminator.

<!-- release-docs: covered=formatter,embeditor -->
### A LOOP closed by UNTIL or WHILE is no longer an error, and Ctrl+I keeps it level

Folding was not the only part of the editor that thought a `LOOP` needed an `END`. In an embed slot, the structure check underlined `LOOP ... UNTIL x` with *"LOOP is not terminated with END or '.'"*, and **Ctrl+I** indented the `UNTIL` line as part of the loop body &mdash; and everything after it one level too deep. Both now treat `UNTIL` / `WHILE` as closing the innermost `LOOP`, and only a `LOOP`: with an `IF` on top it is still an ordinary line, and the pre-condition form `LOOP WHILE x ... END` still needs its `END`.

<!-- release-docs: covered=formatter -->
### Ctrl+I no longer moves a loop's label off column 1

A labelled structure such as `MyLoop LOOP` &mdash; the label that `BREAK MyLoop` and `CYCLE MyLoop` name &mdash; had its label indented into the code column by **Ctrl+I**, and a Clarion label that isn't in column 1 no longer compiles. The formatter also never opened the structure, so its body stayed flush and its `END` closed the wrong block. A labelled `LOOP`, `IF`, `CASE`, `ACCEPT`, `EXECUTE` or `BEGIN` now keeps its label in column 1 and lays out exactly as the unlabelled form would.

<!-- release-docs: covered=lsp,mcp,editor -->
### The language-server tools work from a plain Chat, and say why when they can't

Started with the **Chat** button rather than **Work With Open Solution**, the assistant's `lsp_*` tools had no solution even with one open in the IDE, so every call answered *"LSP not running"* &mdash; and `lsp_start` ignored the folder it was given, then blamed a *"client handshake"* that had never been attempted. The tools now follow the solution open in the IDE (and restart on it when you switch), `lsp_start` uses the folder or `.sln` you name, and a start that doesn't happen says which reason applies. **Find All References** also opens the file in the server before asking; without that, a request from the MAP line came back as a single zero-width hit, where the server finds the prototype, the implementation and a `START()` call. **Shift+F12** in the CA Editor no longer silently does Go to Definition.

<!-- release-docs: covered=schema -->
### PostgreSQL: ingest no longer aborts on aggregates, and errors say what happened ([#201](https://github.com/ClarionLive/ClarionAssistant/issues/201), [#188](https://github.com/ClarionLive/ClarionAssistant/issues/188))

Indexing a PostgreSQL database that had a user-defined **aggregate** failed outright with `42809 wrong_object_type`, and the Index status cell said only *"error"*. Aggregates are now skipped (window functions are still indexed &mdash; only aggregates break `pg_get_functiondef()`), and the status cell shows the real message. **Test Connection** now says plainly when `Npgsql.dll` is missing, instead of showing the .NET loader error &mdash; and says something different when it is present but can't be loaded, so a broken install no longer looks like a missing one. Bundling Npgsql with the installer is still to come.

<!-- release-docs: covered=build-tools -->
### A locked .app is reported as a lock ([#204](https://github.com/ClarionLive/ClarionAssistant/issues/204))

`build_app` and `generate_source` default to the app open in your IDE &mdash; which is the IDE holding it open &mdash; so ClarionCL failed with *"Could not gain access to MyApp.ap~"* / *"Cannot open application … (status 32)"*, reading exactly like a template or source error. The result now carries a **DIAGNOSIS** line saying the `.app` is locked by a Clarion IDE, most likely this one, and to close it there and retry.

### CA Editor and Embeditor: Mark Word on Ctrl+W ([#229](https://github.com/ClarionLive/ClarionAssistant/issues/229))

**Ctrl+W** marks the word at the caret. A word is letters, digits and underscores &mdash; the colon is deliberately not part of one &mdash; so in `LOC:CustomerName` it marks just `LOC` or just `CustomerName`, the one way to take either half on its own (double-click takes the whole name). Press **Ctrl+W** again while that half is still selected and it widens to the whole `LOC:CustomerName`, the same word double-click takes. It works at every cursor, only changes the selection, and can be rebound in the gear panel's **Keyboard** section. Requested and contributed by Rick Martin ([PR #231](https://github.com/ClarionLive/ClarionAssistant/pull/231)).

<!-- release-docs: covered=mcp,embeditor -->
### The embeditor tools reach large procedures, and never save over your unsaved edits ([PR #198](https://github.com/ClarionLive/ClarionAssistant/pull/198))

On a large procedure `apply_embed_edits` and `open_procedure_embed` always failed with *"UI thread did not respond within 30s"* while the IDE was simply working: every UI-thread tool shared one 30-second budget, and a single native embeditor open can take 45 seconds by itself. The four slow tools &mdash; `open_procedure_embed`, `apply_embed_edits`, `save_and_close_embeditor` and `warmup_abc` &mdash; now get **180 seconds**; everything else keeps 30. To give every UI-thread tool more, add `Mcp.UiToolTimeoutSeconds` to `%APPDATA%\ClarionAssistant\settings.txt` (5&ndash;600 seconds; it never lowers a tool below its own minimum). `apply_embed_edits` can now use a procedure you already have open in the embeditor, but only when it has **no unsaved changes** and no CA Embeditor is showing it &mdash; otherwise it refuses and writes nothing, so it can never save your edits along with its own. And a call that timed out **no longer saves late**: a call the IDE never started does not run, `apply_embed_edits` discards instead of saving, `save_and_close_embeditor` does not save, and the message says what really happened.

<!-- release-docs: covered=lsp -->
### `lsp_diagnostics` no longer calls a file clean too early ([#216](https://github.com/ClarionLive/ClarionAssistant/issues/216))

`lsp_diagnostics` is how the assistant checks its own edits, and it could answer *"no errors"* before the language server had finished. Since v1.0.4 the server ends every analysis with an explicit status for the file, and the bundled client now waits for it: only a **complete** for this file, at the version we sent, ends the wait, and running out of time still answers *"pending"*, never *"clean"*. Older servers keep the previous behaviour. With Mark Sarson's ClarionLsp addin installed, requests go through the addin, and clarion-lsp v1.4.3 does the same wait.

<!-- release-docs: covered=editor,monaco -->
### CA Editor: squiggles on the right line, the whole font list, and no white flash ([#176](https://github.com/ClarionLive/ClarionAssistant/issues/176), [#184](https://github.com/ClarionLive/ClarionAssistant/issues/184), [#195](https://github.com/ClarionLive/ClarionAssistant/issues/195))

**Squiggles no longer land lines off:** a slow diagnostics reply to an older request could overwrite a newer one and draw its lines over a buffer that had since changed; a stale reply is now dropped and a fresh check runs. **The Font family box shows the whole list:** the browser filtered it by the font already in the box, so only that font appeared. It is now a **plain dropdown** &mdash; *Default* plus the same fonts, the whole list every time, and a pick applies at once. A saved font that is not in the list (an older fallback list, or a font imported from VS Code) is kept as an extra entry rather than dropped. **No white flash on open:** everything shown before the editor paints now uses the editor's own background in the CA Editor and the CA Embeditor, and under **Windows High Contrast** the contrast theme's window colour.

<!-- release-docs: covered=completion,embeditor -->
### Completion lists a member once ([#187](https://github.com/ClarionLive/ClarionAssistant/issues/187))

Member completion showed some methods twice, because the language server sent them twice and nothing removed the repeat. Identical items are now listed once; overloads with the same bare name but a different signature are kept. Found along the way: in the CA Embeditor, a buffer that already started with `MEMBER` or `PROGRAM` sent every position to the language server **one line low** and mapped every answer back one line high &mdash; fixed, though not shown to be the reporter's cause. The separate report in that issue about completion after `st.` in a data embed could not be reproduced and is not claimed fixed.

<!-- release-docs: covered=embeditor -->
### The embeditor finds generated modules through your redirection file ([PR #228](https://github.com/ClarionLive/ClarionAssistant/pull/228))

The CA Embeditor looked for the procedure's generated `.clw` only **next to the `.app`**, so if your `.red` sends generated source elsewhere, every embed quietly fell back to a path that does not exist, and diagnostics and navigation ran against nothing. It now resolves through the redirection file, searching `[Debug32]`, `[Release32]`, `[Debug]` and `[Release]` before `[Common]`, and honouring the `.app` folder's own `.red` ahead of the solution's. **Behaviour change:** Clarion only honours a local `.red` named for the running version (`Clarion120.red`, say) and ignores any other `*.red` in the folder; Clarion Assistant used to take the first `*.red` it found in a solution or app folder, and now follows Clarion's rule, so a misnamed or backup `.red` is ignored. This came out of [#179](https://github.com/ClarionLive/ClarionAssistant/issues/179) but does **not** fix its access violation.

<!-- release-docs: covered=instance-coord -->
### A hung Clarion no longer sits on the multi-instance roster forever ([PR #208](https://github.com/ClarionLive/ClarionAssistant/pull/208))

A Clarion IDE that hung without exiting kept its place in the list of running instances the others check for procedure conflicts, so they kept colliding with it until a reboot. An instance that stops responding is now dropped after about **two minutes of not responding continuously**. One slow answer is not enough, because a busy IDE mid-build or mid-generation gives the same answer, and a busy IDE that was dropped puts itself back once it responds again.

<!-- release-docs: covered=explorer -->
### CA Explorer matches the running Clarion to the right version ([#209](https://github.com/ClarionLive/ClarionAssistant/issues/209))

When Clarion's record of the current version is missing, stale or says *"(Current ...)"*, the version is worked out from the running `Clarion.exe`'s bin folder &mdash; and it took the **first** entry with that folder, although every install registers its Clarion.NET compiler on the same bin. The IDE could be treated as its own .NET compiler. It now prefers the Win32 entry whose build number matches the running exe. The same version decides the `.red` file, the language server and CodeGraph, not only the CA Explorer banner and recents.

<!-- release-docs: covered=mcp -->
### `append_to_file` no longer adds a blank line ([#232](https://github.com/ClarionLive/ClarionAssistant/issues/232))

It always wrote a line break before the new text, so appending to a file that already ended with one left a blank line. It now adds the break only when the file does not already end in one; encoding handling is unchanged.

<!-- release-docs: covered=editor,embeditor -->
### Large procedures no longer crash the IDE from the CA Editor or Embeditor

On an 86,722-line, 3.2 MB generated module the 32-bit Clarion IDE could die out of memory with a CA Embeditor open, because the editor sent its **whole buffer** with every hover, completion, definition, diagnostics, outline and folding request. Both Monaco editors now send the buffer **once per edit** and requests only name the version they are about &mdash; twenty hovers on a 3.2 MB buffer went from 66 MB of traffic to 3.3 MB. The diagnostics timeout now grows with the buffer (up to 60 seconds). That fixed the crash but not the wait; the next entry fixes the wait.

<!-- release-docs: covered=editor,embeditor,lsp,codegraph,schemagraph -->
### Completion, hover and squiggles are instant on large procedures

On that same 86,722-line module, completion in the CA Embeditor showed *"Loading…"* for four seconds and then *"No suggestions"*. A hover took 1 to 35 seconds, and a `DO` of a missing routine took about **five minutes** to get its squiggle. The native embeditor is instant, and that is the bar. We measured first. The language server re-analyses the **whole** module on every edit, and is just as slow in VS Code, so Clarion Assistant now **answers first from what it already knows** and treats the language server as a late extra:

- **Completion:** your procedure's locals, **parameters**, routines and group fields; class members, including `SELF.` in a `ThisWindow` method with inherited `WindowManager` members; CodeGraph procedures and globals; `PRE:` fields from the **live** dictionary (no ingest); and keywords.
- **Hover:** the same sources. Keywords, attributes and built-ins now show **what they do**: `DERIVED`, `RETURN`, `CLIP(STRING string)` and so on, from the language server's own data files.
- **Squiggles:** structure errors and a `DO` of a missing routine appear as soon as they're computed. The language server's squiggles are added when they arrive.

Measured on that module, from keystroke to list on screen: completion **43 ms** typical and **119 ms** at worst, hover **7&ndash;35 ms**, and the `DO` squiggle in under a second.

- **Typing no longer ships the module around.** Each keystroke used to send the whole 3.2 MB buffer to the IDE. It now sends a few hundred characters around the caret, and the full buffer goes over only when you pause.
- **CodeGraph lookups went from 150&ndash;500 ms to about 0.2 ms.** They keep one connection open and use new case-insensitive indexes. Existing databases get the indexes automatically, built once in the background, with no re-index needed.

**Also fixed along the way:**
- Locals declared before a `ThisWindow CLASS` were invisible to completion and hover in every ABC procedure.
- Other procedures' parameters were offered as globals.
- After a save and reopen, squiggles could be painted from an **older** version of the file, landing on the wrong lines and even inside comments. Diagnostics now have to belong to the text on screen.
- A language-server crash is now logged instead of vanishing.
- The bundled language server now starts as soon as a solution opens. It used to wait for a Clarion Assistant chat tab, so with only the IDE and a CA Embeditor open it never started at all.

<!-- release-docs: covered=header,schema -->
### The header has tabs: Solution, Schema Sources and Source Control

Schema Sources and Source Control are settings of the **solution**, but they lived in a collapsed *"Solution Settings"* bar inside each chat tab, where most people never found them. They are now tabs of the header itself, beside **Solution**, and show on every tab, Home included. The **Schema Sources** tab shows how many sources are linked, and both follow the solution selected in the header.

- **The header has a fixed height.** The drag bar under it is gone.
- **&#10697; beside SOLUTION** copies the solution's full path to the clipboard.
- **RED is a link.** Click it to open the `.red` file in an IDE editor tab. When no redirection file could be found it stays a warning and is not clickable.
- **The &#9678; "Show/hide LSP Diagnostics bar" toggle is gone**, and so is the bar. Squiggles in the CA Editor and CA Embeditor show the same diagnostics where you are looking.

<!-- release-docs: covered=close -->
### Clarion closes faster

Closing the IDE could take about **20 seconds**, even when no CA Embeditor had been opened. Two causes came in during this release cycle, and both are fixed. The **Schema Sources / Source Control** panel, a browser component, was created in every session and had to be torn down at close; it is now created only the first time you open one of those tabs. And the language server was stopped **on the UI thread** when the solution closed, holding the IDE for about 0.4 seconds; it now stops in the background.

Closing is noticeably faster. Measured with an external timer: about **8 seconds** from the solution closing to Clarion exiting, of which Clarion Assistant's own share is about half a second; the rest is Clarion's own teardown. To diagnose a slow close, `%APPDATA%\ClarionAssistant\shutdown.log` now records a `[close +N ms]` line for each step.

<!-- release-docs: covered=version -->
### Clarion Assistant follows Build > Set Clarion Version

The IDE keeps a Clarion version per solution (**Build > Set Clarion Version**). Clarion Assistant read it only at startup or on a solution change, and a version picked in its own **VERSION** dropdown was one global setting that beat the IDE forever &mdash; honoured by some parts of Clarion Assistant and not others. Now **Clarion Assistant shows the Clarion version the IDE has selected and no longer has its own version picker**: VERSION is a read-only display, followed when the IDE's choice changes (the `.red` reloads and the bundled language server restarts), and **every part of Clarion Assistant uses the same version**. With the IDE on **(Current Version)** it shows the running Clarion's own version, marked **(IDE)**; &#8635; re-reads the IDE's choice. The stale mix-up where a Clarion 12 IDE showed `Clarion 10 Active And Updated (saved)` is gone: versions saved by the old dropdown are simply ignored.

<!-- release-docs: covered=explorer -->
### CA Explorer's header says what it means

The header read like `Clarion10v8 · clbrws`, a version folder and a solution name run together. It now shows labelled lines: **APP** (or **SOLUTION** when no app is open), **VERSION**, **ROOT** and **RED**. Clicking **APP** shows the file in Windows Explorer, and **ROOT** opens the folder.

<!-- release-docs: covered=editor,formatter -->
### CA Embeditor: the caret and Enter stay with the code

Two older problems found in install testing. With **Can move caret behind EOL** and word wrap on, a click beside a wrapped line set the caret's goal column to about the window width, so later up/down moves padded lines out to ~column 125 and Enter carried that indent on; a click there is now an ordinary click. And **Enter after END**, **Enter** and **Ctrl+I** re-indent from the code you can see: the formatter counted structures from the top of the whole generated module, and code it does not model (such as `OMIT` / `COMPILE` blocks) could throw an embed's block out to column 125. Re-indenting now stays anchored to the surrounding code.

<!-- release-docs: covered=completion,ctrl-d,focus,knowledge -->
### Community fixes

- **Completion after `SELF.` and `PARENT.`** no longer resolves to an unrelated class ([PR #221](https://github.com/ClarionLive/ClarionAssistant/pull/221)) &mdash; a name lookup was matching ABPOPUP's explicit `SELF` parameter, so every `SELF.` offered `PopupClass` members.
- **Member completion on `GROUP` / `QUEUE`** is right again ([PR #219](https://github.com/ClarionLive/ClarionAssistant/pull/219)): a one-line `GROUP(T) END` no longer swallows the procedure's locals as its fields, and a typed `QUEUE(Type)` no longer uses its incomplete inline field list as the member filter.
- **Colon-qualified completion** no longer duplicates or truncates the name you typed ([PR #215](https://github.com/ClarionLive/ClarionAssistant/pull/215)).
- **A trailing period on an ordinary statement** now closes its structure in the embed-slot structure check, ending false *"unterminated"* warnings ([PR #226](https://github.com/ClarionLive/ClarionAssistant/pull/226)).
- **Ctrl+D** no longer opens the wrong designer when a structure keyword is used as a plain label, such as a variable named `report` ([PR #220](https://github.com/ClarionLive/ClarionAssistant/pull/220)).
- **The CodeGraph indexer's window buttons** work again &mdash; the editor's focus guard was taking focus back from them ([PR #217](https://github.com/ClarionLive/ClarionAssistant/pull/217)).
- **Knowledge entries can be retired**: `supersede_knowledge` and `remove_knowledge` let a wrong entry stop being injected, instead of only being contradicted by a newer one ([PR #199](https://github.com/ClarionLive/ClarionAssistant/pull/199)).

<!-- release-docs: covered=debugger,debugger-hook -->
### CA Debugger: the execution line and Run to Cursor work in the CA Editor

With the CA Editor (Monaco) in front, the CA Debugger painted **no execution-line marker**, because the navigation it used only scrolls. The CA Editor now paints the debugger's current line itself and keeps it across reloads and reopen. Right-clicking now offers **Run to Cursor**, which runs a paused debug session to the caret without going to the pad toolbar, and refuses rather than guessing if its tab did not become the active window. Clarion Assistant finds the debugger at runtime by assembly identity, so nothing changes if it isn't installed.

<!-- release-docs: covered=terminal,deploy,bom-guard -->
### Under the hood

- **Messaging in IDE terminals.** Claude Code 2.1.265 stopped resolving the MultiTerminal channel supplied on the command line, so every IDE terminal printed *"no MCP server configured with that name"* and quietly fell back to polling. The channel now arrives through the plugin.
- **Deploy is stricter.** It refuses to deploy onto a running Clarion, never reports success on a partial copy, fails when the shipped language server does not match its pin, and is gated on the BOM guard &mdash; which now also fails if it scanned nothing, rather than passing vacuously. `deploy.ps1` parses under Windows PowerShell 5.1 again.
- **The shipped language server is checked, not just its source.** Deploy and the installer build hash the `server.js` they ship and compare it with the pinned version's recorded hash; a proven mismatch is refused unless `-AllowUnpinnedLsp` is passed, and `Sync-LspServer.ps1 -Pure` refuses a non-git source tree unless `-TrustNonGitTree` is passed ([PR #191](https://github.com/ClarionLive/ClarionAssistant/pull/191)).
- **`deploy.ps1 -Version all` starts faster.** Its search for Clarion installs scanned every mounted drive, network shares included; it now scans local fixed drives only ([PR #211](https://github.com/ClarionLive/ClarionAssistant/pull/211)).

<!-- release-docs: covered=installer -->
### Installing no longer corrupts non-ASCII characters in your Claude Code settings ([#200](https://github.com/ClarionLive/ClarionAssistant/issues/200))

A follow-on to [#190](https://github.com/ClarionLive/ClarionAssistant/issues/190), and the same root cause: the installer's configuration step runs under **Windows PowerShell 5.1**, where two defaults are not what they appear. Reading `settings.json` without naming an encoding decoded it as the machine's **ANSI codepage**, so every non-ASCII character was mangled on the way *in* and written back mangled &mdash; a typographic apostrophe became `â€™`. Writing it back with `-Encoding UTF8` added a **byte-order mark** to a file that belongs to Claude Code, because that same token means *with* BOM on 5.1 and *without* on PowerShell 7. And a **successful** merge kept no backup at all: a copy was only ever written when the installer *refused* to write, which is why the 5.8 notes pointed people at a backup file the normal path never produced. All three are fixed, a backup is now written before the file is overwritten, and an already-BOM'd file from 5.8 is read correctly and cleaned. **Characters already mangled on disk cannot be recovered** &mdash; the original bytes are gone. The installer's configuration script is now covered by a regression test that runs it under a real 5.1 host and checks the result byte by byte.

### Version numbers now mean one thing ([#200](https://github.com/ClarionLive/ClarionAssistant/issues/200) groundwork for AddinFinder)

The released version is now **Major.Minor.Patch** &mdash; one number, shared by `Version.props`, the addin manifest and the git tag. Previously the third component was a build counter that incremented on **every compile**, so the manifest said `5.8.1165` while the release was tagged `v5.8.1` and the installer carried a third, hand-maintained `5.8.1`. AddinFinder compares the manifest against the release tag, so any disagreement shows as *"Update available"* permanently, and reinstalling cannot clear it.

**This is why the jump is to 5.9.0 rather than 5.8.2.** AddinFinder only ever lets a recorded version move *forward*, and it compares component by component &mdash; so against a manifest already reporting `5.8.1165`, the number `5.8.2` compares as **lower** (2 against 1165) and would have left every existing user stuck on that message forever, while looking perfectly correct on any fresh install. The build counter has not gone away: it still increments and still appears in the DLL's file properties and in the docked pad's title (`5.9.0.1165`), where it is useful for support.

### The About box now shows the full version number

The About box reported `5.9` where every other surface reports `5.9.0.1165`. It built the string from the assembly version's **Major and Minor only**, dropping the patch and the build counter &mdash; the two components that actually distinguish one install from another. It now shows all four, which matters mostly for support: the build counter is how you tell a deployed build apart from the one before it, and reading it off the About box is the quickest way to get it.

### The VS Code import preview no longer promises a font it cannot deliver

Importing settings from VS Code previews what will change. Where **Follow Clarion's editor options** is ticked some of those values are owned by the IDE rather than the pad, and the preview already warned about that on the indentation rows &mdash; but not on **Font size** and **Font family**, which are follow-mode-owned too. So the preview offered a font change, the import stored it correctly, and the editor carried on showing the IDE's font, leaving the setting looking silently ignored; unticking follow-mode reveals the imported value was there the whole time. The warning now appears on the font rows as well, and only when the IDE is actually reporting a font, so it never warns about a setting that would in fact have applied.

### Bundled skills: the marketplace ones said .NET 4.8, the templates build 4.7.2

The ClarionCOM skills that ship with Clarion Assistant told you your project targets **net48**. Both shipped templates target **net472** &mdash; `ClarionCOMTemplate.csproj` and `WebView2Template.csproj` alike. That is not a label being out by a decimal point: the deployment skill sent you to copy build output from `bin/Release/net48/`, **a path MSBuild never writes**, and the control checklist would fail a correctly configured project. Corrected throughout the four affected skills.

The blanket rule against generating Clarion code was also too broad, and is narrowed from *"never generate Clarion code examples"* to *"never hand-write per-control examples"*. The reason it needed narrowing: the Clarion templates cover the **inbound** half only &mdash; `UltimateCOM.tpl` and the `UltimateCOM` class handle instantiation, placement and events &mdash; while every outbound method call and data payload is hand-written by the developer with no guidance anywhere in the product. A fixed, reviewed calling-convention block now fills exactly that gap, checked against the SoftVelocity Help topics *"Parameter Passing to OLE/OCX Methods"* and *"Calling OLE Object Methods"*. The original concern, that improvised per-control Clarion would likely be wrong, is preserved and still enforced.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

| Requirement | Notes |
|---|---|
| **Clarion IDE** (v10, v11, or v12) | Auto-detected from Windows registry |
| **Claude Code CLI** | [Download from Anthropic](https://claude.ai/download) |
| **WebView2 Runtime** | Pre-installed on Windows 11; [download for Windows 10](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/webview2/) |

### What leaves your machine

Clarion Assistant is a front end for the **Claude Code CLI**, and that CLI talks to Anthropic's API
over the internet. When you use the assistant, what you type and the file contents it reads on your
behalf &mdash; source, embed code, dictionary and schema details, build output &mdash; are sent to
Anthropic to produce a reply. The IDE tools described in this README are how the assistant reads
that context, so anything you point it at is potentially part of a request.

That is the product working as intended rather than a hidden behaviour, but it is your code, so it
should be stated plainly: **do not use it on material you are not permitted to send to a third-party
API.** Anthropic's terms and privacy policy govern what happens to it &mdash; see
[Anthropic Privacy](https://www.anthropic.com/legal/privacy). Your Claude Code account and its
settings, not this addin, control that relationship.

A few other features reach the network only when you explicitly invoke them: ingesting
documentation from a URL, GitHub operations, and the marketplace browser.

### Install

1. **[Download the latest installer](https://github.com/ClarionLive/ClarionAssistant/releases/latest)** (code-signed)
2. Close the Clarion IDE
3. Run the installer &mdash; select which Clarion versions to install for
4. Restart the Clarion IDE

**One row per Clarion version, and they are not interchangeable.** Each row installs the addin *built for that version*, compiled against that Clarion's own IDE assemblies &mdash; so pointing the "Clarion 10 folder" row at a Clarion 12 installation ships the wrong build and it won't load. The installer now checks the version of whatever folder you enter and warns you if it doesn't match the row.

**More than one installation of the same version?** That's supported &mdash; press the **`+`** button on that version's row and pick the extra folder. Each extra gets a copy of that row's addin once the install finishes, and the list is remembered for next time. Handy if you keep, say, two Clarion 12 trees side by side.

> One trap worth knowing: never leave a spare or backup copy of the addin folder anywhere *inside* an `accessory\addins` tree. Clarion scans subfolders, and a duplicate makes startup fail with *"Identity name used by multiple addins."* Keep backups outside.

## Building from Source

### Requirements

- Visual Studio 2022 (Community or higher)
- .NET Framework 4.8 SDK
- Clarion IDE (for reference assemblies in `{Clarion}\bin\`)
- [Inno Setup 6](https://jrsoftware.org/isdl.php) (for building the installer)

### Configuring your Clarion path

The build uses `Directory.Build.props` at the repo root to locate your Clarion installation. The defaults assume John's machine layout (`C:\Clarion12`, `C:\Clarion11-13372`, `C:\Clarion10`).

If your Clarion is installed elsewhere, create a `Directory.Build.props.user` file alongside `Directory.Build.props` (it is gitignored — never commit it):

```xml
<Project>
  <!-- Replace with your actual Clarion installation path -->
  <PropertyGroup>
    <ClarionRoot>C:\Clarion\Clarion12</ClarionRoot>
  </PropertyGroup>
</Project>
```

The `.user` file overrides the defaults for all `ClarionVersion` values, so a single path entry is enough if you only build for one version. You can still pass `/p:ClarionVersion=11` on the command line to select the target version.

Alternatively, pass the path directly on the command line without creating a `.user` file:

```powershell
msbuild ClarionAssistant.csproj /p:ClarionVersion=11 /p:ClarionRoot="C:\Clarion\Clarion11.1"
```

### Build

```powershell
# Build for a specific version (uses Directory.Build.props.user if present)
cd ClarionAssistant
msbuild ClarionAssistant.csproj /p:Configuration=Debug /p:ClarionVersion=12

# Build the addin for all Clarion versions via deploy script
.\deploy.ps1 -NoBuild:$false -Version all
```

> **Note:** Use MSBuild directly — do **not** use `dotnet build`. WebView2 NuGet resolution fails with the .NET CLI on this .NET Framework 4.8 project.

### Deploy for Development

```powershell
# Deploy to your local Clarion IDE (builds + copies DLLs)
cd ClarionAssistant
.\deploy.ps1 -Version 12

# Deploy without rebuilding (e.g. HTML-only changes)
.\deploy.ps1 -Version 12 -NoBuild

# Kill the IDE before deploying (when DLLs are locked)
.\deploy.ps1 -Version 12 -Kill
```

### Running the tests

```powershell
cd ClarionAssistant
.\tests\Run-Tests.ps1
```

One entry point for both harness families: standalone `csc` harnesses over IDE-free service code
(`tests\`), and node harnesses over the Monaco WebView2 pages (`Terminal\test\`). Neither is wired into
MSBuild &mdash; they exist to be run before you deploy, because the bugs they catch (a NUL byte inside a
420 KB HTML file, a settings panel that reads fine in dark mode and is illegible in light) pass a clean
build and fail a human.

Most need nothing installed. One page test needs `jsdom`, declared as a devDependency:

```powershell
npm install --prefix Terminal\test
```

Without it that test reports *could not run* and fails the overall run rather than reporting green. See
[`tests/README.md`](ClarionAssistant/tests/README.md) for what each harness guards.
