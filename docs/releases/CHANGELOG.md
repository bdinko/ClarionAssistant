# Release History

Archived 'What''s New' summaries from the project [README](../../README.md), **v5.8.1 back to v3.0**.

These are the README's editorial digests, not the release notes: they were written
deliberately shorter, for someone scrolling a landing page. Where a full release-notes
file exists it is linked from the section itself. For **4.x and 3.x no release-notes
file was ever written**, so these summaries are the only record of those releases.

The README keeps the current release and the one before it; everything older lands here.
Full notes for recent versions are in [this folder](.).

## What's New in v5.8.1

A patch release that fixes something 5.8 broke. Full notes: **[docs/releases/v5.8.1.md](v5.8.1.md)**.

### Clarion starts again after installing the Markdown editor

Installing 5.8 could leave `accessory\addins\MarkdownEditor` holding **exactly one file** &mdash; the `.addin` manifest &mdash; and none of the assemblies it names. Clarion reads that manifest at startup, fails to load the DLL beside it, and **stops with two dialogs instead of opening**. The editor's files ship as one wildcard entry, and Inno Setup evaluates such an entry's install check *once per expanded file*; the manifest sorts alphabetically first, so it was written, and every remaining file then re-ran the check, found the manifest just written reporting the version being installed, took the "you already have this" branch and was skipped. The gate destroyed its own precondition. Reinstalling did not help &mdash; that lone manifest kept reporting the current version, so the broken state was exactly the state the repair logic refused to repair. The decision is now made once per Clarion version and frozen before the first write, and a manifest with no assembly beside it is treated as damage rather than as an install, which is what **repairs already-broken machines in place**. A copy of the editor newer than the bundled one is still left alone.

### Markdown editor v1.3.0

The bundled editor moves to **[v1.3.0](https://github.com/msarson/ClarionMarkdownEditor/releases/tag/v1.3.0)** &mdash; auto-refresh, remembered view preferences, and resizable panes.

> The Clarion Assistant addin itself is unchanged from 5.8: same binaries, same version stamp. Only the installer's logic and the Markdown editor it carries are different.

### Thanks

- The user who reported this on **Discord**, with both dialogs captured. The screenshots named the file and the path, which is what separated "the DLL is missing" from "the DLL cannot load" &mdash; very different bugs.

## What's New in v5.8

5.8 is the CodeGraph release &mdash; and one apology. Full notes: **[docs/releases/v5.8.0.md](v5.8.0.md)**.

> **Re-index your solutions and re-import your documentation after updating.** This release corrects what gets *read*, not what is already stored.

### Installing no longer wipes your Claude Code settings ([#190](https://github.com/ClarionLive/ClarionAssistant/issues/190))

Every install, on every machine, overwrote `%USERPROFILE%\.claude\settings.json` &mdash; Claude Code's own global configuration &mdash; leaving only the handful of keys the installer itself writes. `hooks`, `statusLine`, `model`, `tui`, your plugins and your own `permissions.allow` entries were gone, and losing `hooks` is the worst of it because nothing announces it. The installer runs its configuration step under Windows PowerShell 5.1 and the script asked for a JSON option that only exists in PowerShell 6+, so the parse failed every time &mdash; and the error handler mistook its own unsupported call for a corrupt user file, backed it up, and rebuilt from empty. **If this hit you, your settings are still on disk:** look next to the file for `settings.json.backup.` plus a timestamp. The parse works on both hosts now, a genuine failure leaves your file alone, a guard refuses any write that would drop a top-level key, and the installer build fails if any of its scripts would not load under real 5.1.

### CodeGraph: thirty times faster, and no longer confidently wrong

A full index of a 27-app production solution fell from **1:12 to 2:42**, with the output verified identical row by row. The correctness half matters more: "who calls X" could answer with the wrong X entirely, because every call in every app resolved to one arbitrary copy of a shared procedure name. Resolution is now scoped the way the compiler thinks, genuinely ambiguous picks are **marked** rather than asserted, and prototypes are told apart from implementations &mdash; which also fixes a documented dead-code query that was returning **98.7% false positives**.

Three whole categories of code had been invisible. **Procedures whose labels contain a colon** were never indexed at all &mdash; in generated Clarion that is the entire referential-integrity layer, so "what breaks if I delete from this table" returned nothing. **Routine bodies** were never scanned, because a `ROUTINE` label switched the scanner off and `DO ProcedureReturn` prefix-matched the PROCEDURE pattern. And **global data** &mdash; your PROGRAM file's declaration section &mdash; was skipped entirely, with references to an imported global landing on the importing app's copy instead of the declaration you navigate to. The test solution went from 478 thousand relationships to **1.1 million**.

### Indexing shows its work, and the tools stream it

Starting an index opens a **progress window**: apps ticked off as they parse, the file being read, a bar weighted by where the time actually goes, and an estimate seeded from your last run. It can be **cancelled** &mdash; a cancelled full index deletes the partial database rather than leaving something that passes for complete. The transcript is always written to `%APPDATA%\ClarionAssistant\codegraph-index.log`, and the window no longer steals focus from the IDE. Over MCP, `index_solution` and `index_codegraph` now stream live progress and return real completion stats instead of an hour of silence.

### Asking the assistant to build compiles what is on your screen

The assistant's build tools shelled straight out to `ClarionCL` without entering the IDE's build pipeline, so the hook that saves unsaved CA Editor tabs never ran &mdash; the toolbar button saved them, the assistant did not, and you got the stale build. Alongside it: **saving no longer throws the caret to line 1** (our own write looked like an external change to the native editor underneath, whose caret reset was then faithfully mirrored into view), and the editor no longer keeps its unsaved-changes dot on a file it has just saved. **`.tpl` and `.tpw`** listed in Editor Surfaces finally open in the editor, and writing an entry as `*.tpl` no longer produces a pattern that silently matches nothing.

### Markdown editor, embeditor, and per-environment history

Mark Sarson's **[Markdown editor](https://github.com/msarson/ClarionMarkdownEditor)** now ships in the installer, pinned like the bundled language server, and is left alone if you already have a newer copy. The **CA Embeditor** attaches in colon-named procedure suites ([#196](https://github.com/ClarionLive/ClarionAssistant/issues/196)) &mdash; on one reporter's application it had never attached once in six weeks. Two Clarion environments started with `/ConfigDir=` no longer **share one application history** ([#197](https://github.com/ClarionLive/ClarionAssistant/issues/197)); CA had been rebuilding the path from the executable's version stamp, and Clarion 11 and 11.1 both report `11.0`. Migration-free &mdash; a default install resolves to exactly the string it did before.

### Also fixed

**Documentation search stops mangling accented characters** &mdash; the ingester read UTF-8 documents as the machine's ANSI codepage, and the wrong encoding was passed *explicitly*, which is how it survived two previous sweeps. The **embedded assistant knows about every tool it has** in the copy that actually ships: 5.7 went out with a prompt missing 51 registered tools, because the fix had landed in a file that gets overwritten on every terminal start. A release **could ship with no language server** and say so in one grey line among thirty green ones. And CA terminals now **leave the MultiTerminal roster** when they close &mdash; three separate defects, the decisive one being that `localhost` stalled every call to its timeout, which had also left the Agents pad showing stale data.

### Thanks

- **[@KevinErskine](https://github.com/KevinErskine)** &mdash; [#190](https://github.com/ClarionLive/ClarionAssistant/issues/190), and the before-and-after copies of his settings file that made the damage measurable rather than inferred.
- **[@bill-atchison](https://github.com/bill-atchison)** &mdash; [#196](https://github.com/ClarionLive/ClarionAssistant/issues/196), reported with the root cause and a proposed fix, both of which held up against the source.
- **[@BoxSoft](https://github.com/BoxSoft)** &mdash; [#197](https://github.com/ClarionLive/ClarionAssistant/issues/197), and the dual-environment detail that explained why two Clarion versions collided on one identity.
- **[Mark Sarson](https://github.com/msarson)** &mdash; for the Markdown editor this release redistributes.

## What's New in v5.7

5.7 is a parity-and-reliability release. Full notes: **[docs/releases/v5.7.0.md](v5.7.0.md)**.

### Native embeditor parity &mdash; Ctrl+J / Ctrl+B

The CA Embeditor answers **Ctrl+J** (next filled embed) and **Ctrl+B** (previous) like the native one, wrapping at either end and acting on the focused split pane ([#185](https://github.com/ClarionLive/ClarionAssistant/issues/185), BoxSoft). The code-snippet picker moves to **Ctrl+Shift+J** &mdash; Ctrl+J is classic Clarion's snippet gesture in the *text* editor, but the *embeditor* owes it to embed navigation &mdash; and becomes rebindable like every other command, so it can be put back if you prefer. An unfiltered **Next/Previous Embed (any)** ships unbound.

### Errors-pane navigation survives opening a generated .clw

Clicking a row for one procedure after another row had opened the generated `.clw` appeared to do nothing. The reveal was always computing the right line &mdash; but the embeditor is a view *inside* the application window rather than a tab of its own, so raising it needed both levels, and opening the `.clw` closes the native embed underneath, leaving a surface where **Save** said "nothing to save" and **Cancel** blanked the buffer. Such a row now goes to Clarion's own navigation, which re-opens the embeditor properly.

### A language server call can no longer freeze the IDE

An embed save or cancel could hang the IDE for close to a minute &mdash; measured at 57.7s &mdash; waiting synchronously on an async language-server call from the UI thread. An audit found **twelve** such sites, not the two reported, so the pattern is fixed rather than one more symptom. Separately, an application **global** flagged `'X' is not declared in this file` while hovering correctly as a global is suppressed pending the upstream fix ([Clarion-Extension issue 396](https://github.com/msarson/Clarion-Extension/issues/396)).

### Community fixes

**Go-to-definition** stops resolving to an unrelated procedure's local variable ([#182](https://github.com/ClarionLive/ClarionAssistant/pull/182)) &mdash; a guard the hover path already used and the definition path never called. The **editor follows Clarion's live font** ([#183](https://github.com/ClarionLive/ClarionAssistant/pull/183)): it had been reading a property the Options dialog no longer writes to, so font changes never reached the editor. Both from [@geircodes](https://github.com/geircodes). Reviewing #183 turned up a way to lose your own font &mdash; with following on, any unrelated gear change persisted the IDE's font as your stored preference &mdash; fixed before release, along with the same shape in cursor-behind-EOL.

### Folds, encoding, search, installer

Collapsed **folds** are restored on reopen (the state saved but always read back empty), and an ambiguous drifted fold is refused rather than collapsing the wrong region. The Windows-1252 **encoding** sweep is finished &mdash; nineteen more reads, two of them read-modify-*write* &mdash; and reads no longer decode every file twice. **CA Search** opens in your theme instead of always dark ([#181](https://github.com/ClarionLive/ClarionAssistant/issues/181)). The **installer** checks that a folder's Clarion version matches the row it was entered in, and a row now accepts several folders for the same version via **`+`**, closing the gap 5.5's known issues warned about.

### Thanks

- **[@geircodes](https://github.com/geircodes)** &mdash; [#182](https://github.com/ClarionLive/ClarionAssistant/pull/182) and [#183](https://github.com/ClarionLive/ClarionAssistant/pull/183), with reproducers and live verification against a real IDE.
- **Adrián Santarelli** &mdash; the WebView2 post-after-dispose fix, reporting [#179](https://github.com/ClarionLive/ClarionAssistant/issues/179), and the original Ctrl+J snippet requests ([#49](https://github.com/ClarionLive/ClarionAssistant/issues/49), [#154](https://github.com/ClarionLive/ClarionAssistant/issues/154)).
- **BoxSoft** &mdash; [#185](https://github.com/ClarionLive/ClarionAssistant/issues/185), the embed-navigation hotkeys.

## What's New in v5.6

Documentation search is the headline: PDF text extraction now works on every machine instead of only ones that happened to have a third-party tool installed, the extracted text is more accurate, and it is indexed so that a question is answered by the first result rather than the fifth query. Alongside that, a cycle of fixes across the diagnostics path, completion scoping, and the CA Editor's Monaco overlay &mdash; plus a build fix that restores Clarion 10 to the shipped set. Full notes: **[docs/releases/v5.6.0.md](v5.6.0.md)**.

### PDF documentation actually imports &mdash; and is correct (#167)

Importing a folder of PDFs reported "No documentation files found", naming `pdf` as supported in the very message saying nothing was there. The files were found. Text extraction shelled out to an external `pdftotext.exe` that CA never bundled and nothing it requires installs &mdash; not Git for Windows, contrary to what the code's own probe paths assumed. So PDF import worked only on machines where a developer happened to have put one, and silently produced nothing everywhere else.

Extraction is now in-process (PdfPig, Apache-2.0), so it works everywhere with no external dependency.

The bigger surprise was accuracy. Where the old path *did* run, it misaligned multi-column tables: in the Language Reference's date-picture table it paired `@D6` (`dd/mm/yyyy`) with `10/1959` &mdash; which is `@D14`'s value, and cannot be a `dd/mm/yyyy` rendering of any date &mdash; while dropping other cells entirely. Every row now reads correctly. Those tables are exactly what a Clarion developer searches the documentation for, so the old path was not merely unavailable; where it ran, it was indexing wrong answers.

> **Re-import your own PDFs.** Anything already in a personal DocGraph was indexed through the old path and keeps the old text. The bundled documentation shipped with this release is already rebuilt.

### Documentation search answers the question, not the index (#167)

Extraction being correct is not the same as the answer being findable. Asking which three categories `ASCIIFileClass`'s non-virtual methods divide into took **five** queries; it now takes one, and the answer is the first result.

Four things were wrong at once. **Nothing identified the owning class** &mdash; every chunk in the ABC Library Reference was labelled with the book's name, and since every ABC class has an identically-named "Occasional Use" subsection, results from five different classes interleaved with nothing to tell them apart. **Table-of-contents pages outranked real content**: 28.7% of the index was dot-leader lines, which are almost pure keyword, so searching a class name returned page-number lists ahead of prose. **Clarion keywords lifted out of example code became headings** &mdash; 486 chunks titled `ACCEPT`, `PROGRAM` or `RETURN`, including the one holding the ASCIIFileClass text. And **subsection labels were splitting sections apart**, so the three categories landed in three different chunks and no single result could answer the question.

Chunks now carry their real class, contents pages rank below prose, headings read `ASCIIFileClass > GetLastLineNo`, and a section stays whole. Property references in the Language Reference (`PROP:NumTabs` and the rest) get their own headings too, so the definition outranks a passing mention in an example.

Verified against a fixed set of eight retrieval tests, kept with the code at [`ClarionAssistant/docs/DocGraph-Chunking-Verification.md`](../../ClarionAssistant/docs/DocGraph-Chunking-Verification.md), including a guard on the date-picture table above so a future chunking change cannot quietly undo the extraction fix.

Index-noise suppression currently covers documentation whose contents pages put the title and page number on one line &mdash; SoftVelocity's and CapeSoft's. BoxSoft's manuals wrap them across two lines and are not yet recognised.

### Spot which libraries need re-importing

The Documentation Graph panel (Settings &rarr; Data &rarr; Info) gains a **Type** column showing each library's source format, and every column header &mdash; Library, Type, Vendor, Chunks &mdash; is now a sort toggle. Click **Type** to group the PDFs together, which is the fastest way to see what wants a re-import after this release.

### The installer remembers where your Clarion actually is (#142)

Setup derived each Clarion path fresh on every run, registry first, and discarded whatever you corrected in the wizard. If your Clarion isn't where SoftVelocity's installer registered it &mdash; a second copy, or one launched with `/Configdir=` against its own settings folder &mdash; you had to re-enter the path on every release, and forget once.

That failure is quiet: the addin lands in a tree you don't launch, the IDE keeps loading the old one, and the symptoms get reported against a build replaced weeks ago. Paths a run actually installs to are now remembered and offered next time, and validated on read so a tree that has since moved falls back to detection.

### Diagnostics stop reporting false corruption (#168)

Clarion source is saved as Windows-1252/ANSI with no BOM, but four `File.ReadAllText` calls on the LSP text-sync path read it with no encoding argument &mdash; and .NET only auto-detects via BOM. Every single-byte high-bit character (a copyright symbol, say) silently became `U+FFFD` *before* the text reached the language server, which then correctly flagged the replacement character it had been handed. The result was waves of "this character will corrupt the file" warnings &mdash; dozens per file &mdash; on files that are perfectly valid on disk. All four sites now read through `EncodingHelper.DetectFileEncoding`, the same helper the diff viewer got in #94.

### Squiggles stop vanishing (#170)

The squiggle overlay could render nothing at all for a file that the diagnostics pill correctly reported an error for moments later. Four defects, one symptom, all rooted in treating "no information yet" as "authoritatively zero": a premature empty LSP republish was trusted as final (the server publishes progressively, and a slower cross-file check can land in a later batch); a timed-out round-trip was folded into an empty marker list, which *erased* every existing squiggle and its gutter mark rather than merely failing to add one; the client's timeout sat below the host's own worst case, discarding slow-but-successful analyses; and the settle loop parked a thread-pool thread per request. Empty results now get a short settle window before being believed, a timeout leaves the rendered markers alone, the diagnostics call gets its own longer budget while completion and hover keep their short interactive one, and the wait is properly async.

### Diagnostics window follows the CA Editor's theme &mdash; and appears at all (#169)

The LSP status bar and the diagnostics popup rendered in the chat pane's theme, which is a separate setting from the CA Editor's own. They now follow the **active editor's** theme, tracked per Monaco surface rather than read from a process-wide mirror that only ever recorded whichever page spoke last.

Three correctness bugs surfaced in the same code path and are fixed here too. The status bar pill **never appeared** when the IDE's own ClarionLsp addin was the active client &mdash; the visibility check asked the bundled `LspClient`, which in that configuration is never started, so the pill was hidden on every tick and the window it opens was unreachable. Both the liveness check and the cache read now go through `SharedLspBridge`, and the target file is resolved from the active editor instead of "the last file any LSP tool touched". The pill also stopped claiming a green **OK** for files nothing had ever been published about &mdash; unknown now renders as its own muted state rather than being flattened into "clean" during exactly the window when results are still arriving, and the status bar **asks** for diagnostics when it finds none cached instead of reporting "unknown" indefinitely at a cache nothing else was going to fill. And severity colours now survive a live dark&#8646;light switch instead of keeping the previous theme's palette until the rows next rebuilt.

Rounding it out: owner-drawn column headers and grid lines that actually follow the theme, a selection highlight that no longer overrides each row's severity colour, a dark-mode-aware native title bar, and no more hover flicker.

### Completion stops leaking other procedures' locals (#172)

Follow-up to #159. The CodeGraph backfill in bare-prefix completion matched symbol names across the whole indexed solution with no scope awareness, so a variable declared **private to some unrelated procedure in a different file** was offered exactly like a genuine global &mdash; typing `Include` at the top of a PROGRAM file could surface an `IncludeAddress` local from elsewhere entirely. Symbols the indexer already tags as procedure-private are now filtered out of that merge. Locals in the procedure you're actually standing in are unaffected: those come from a live-buffer parse, not the database.

### `DO` completes routines, and only routines

`DO` takes a ROUTINE label and nothing else, so it is now its own completion context answered from routines alone. Routine names are read **from the live buffer**, scoped to the enclosing procedure &mdash; which is a routine's real visibility in Clarion &mdash; so a routine you just typed and haven't saved completes too. Previously `DO` was answered from the general symbol set: typing `DO ref` offered methods from an unrelated `Reflection` class while missing the `RefreshWindow` routine a few lines up.

### Ctrl+X in the CA Editor reaches the clipboard (#173)

Clarion-style Ctrl+X posted the cut text to the host before deleting it from the buffer &mdash; and the CA Editor never implemented its half of that contract, so **Ctrl+X deleted the line without putting anything on the Windows clipboard**. Both stubs left inert since the original overlay spike are now wired: the cut text reaches `Clipboard.SetText`, and a Data-pad field dropped directly onto the editor surface now returns activation to the editor's own tab instead of leaving focus stranded on the pad.

### Show the diagnostics bar again after dismissing it

The LSP status bar &mdash; the strip at the bottom of the assistant pane carrying the diagnostics pill &mdash; has always had its own **&#10005;**, and nothing brought it back: restarting Clarion was the only way. A **&#9678;** button joins the header's title-row actions, beside the theme toggle, and shows or hides it on demand. It repaints from the current state on the way back rather than returning with whatever it was showing when dismissed.

### Clarion 10 builds again

`DiffService` called a `FileService` method that doesn't exist on Clarion 10's older SharpDevelop fork, so the C10 build had been failing outright since the CA Compare write-back work landed &mdash; while 11, 11.1 and 12 compiled clean. It now reaches the same information through an API present on every fork, from one code path.

**If you run Clarion 10, this release is the first to include roughly a week of changes** that never made it into a working C10 binary. The installer ships a per-Clarion build (`bin\Debug-C10` and siblings), so a broken build for one release meant that release shipping stale or not at all.

The deploy script no longer lets one bad target take the others down with it, either: a build failure for a single Clarion version used to abort the run *before* the deploy step, so **nothing** was deployed anywhere while the console showed the other three building successfully. Failures are now collected, every version that built is deployed, and the run ends by naming what didn't ship.

### Class model preview renders again (#171)

In **Create New Class**, any model whose declaration put a Clarion keyword and a quoted string on the same line &mdash; a standard `CLASS,TYPE,MODULE('X.CLW'),LINK('X.CLW')` &mdash; rendered visibly broken markup instead of coloured code. The keyword pass ran over the HTML the string pass had just produced and matched the literal `class` and `string` inside its own attributes. The two passes are now ordered so there is no HTML for the keyword pass to collide with.

### Smart formatter keeps comments where they belong (#161)

Two fixes to **Ctrl+I**, both reported and diagnosed by [@geircodes](https://github.com/geircodes).

A comment sitting among declarations &mdash; inside a `GROUP`/`QUEUE`/`RECORD`/`FILE`, or directly in a procedure's or routine's DATA section &mdash; was indented to the CODE-section column rather than the field column it had been aligned to. It visibly jumped left while every declaration around it formatted correctly, which read as arbitrary rather than as a rule; comments inside `IF`/`CASE`/`LOOP` bodies were never affected, which is what made it look inconsistent. Those comments now line up with the fields they sit among &mdash; and a long banner comment does *not* drag the whole structure's field column to the right with it.

**"Indent comments" now means what it says.** Switching it off used to *delete* a comment's indentation and dump it at column 1, including comments hand-aligned deep inside nested control structures. Off now means leave the comment exactly where it is.

### Thanks

- **geircodes** &mdash; the bulk of this cycle again: the LSP source-encoding fix that ended a wave of false "this character will corrupt the file" warnings (#168), the squiggle overlay going blank on slow or premature results (#170), the diagnostics window's theme plus three correctness bugs found alongside it &mdash; including the status bar pill that never appeared at all (#169), the completion scope leak that surfaced other procedures' locals solution-wide (#172), the CA Editor clipboard and drop-focus stubs (#173), and the class-model preview highlighting (#171). Also reported, diagnosed and wrote the patch for the Ctrl+I comment-indenting fixes (#161), filing it as an issue with the semantics question open rather than as a PR &mdash; which is why "Indent comments OFF" now means something deliberate.
- **Bill Atchison** &mdash; reporting that PDFs would not import (#167). The bug was invisible to anyone whose machine happened to carry a stray `pdftotext.exe`, which is every developer machine here; without the report it would have kept shipping.
- **BoxSoft** &mdash; the installer path report (#142) that turned out to be the reason a whole diagnostic round was spent chasing symptoms in a build that had already been replaced.

## What's New in v5.5

v5.5 turns two read-only surfaces into working ones &mdash; editable diffs and a drag-and-drop Data pad &mdash; and fixes a CodeGraph misattribution that was hiding 59% of the call graph. Full notes: [docs/releases/v5.5.0.md](v5.5.0.md).

### CA Compare &mdash; editable diffs

The diff viewer becomes a working surface rather than a read-only one. Both panes unlock for editing, and each hunk gets a single **apply-change arrow** (Monaco's own gutter revert control) that copies it to the other side; copy direction is chosen per-compare, not per-hunk. Each side saves independently through a write-back path that can't clobber an edit made on the other, **Ctrl+S** saves every changed side at once, and closing the tab &mdash; not just the Close button &mdash; prompts when either side is dirty. The file-path bar shows full paths.

### CA Explorer &mdash; Files tab restructure

The omnibox is rebuilt around a split-button **Open** plus a single search field, joined by a type dropdown, scope pills, and a header **Trace** with mouse-pickable targets, sticky headers, and an actionable trace log. **Compare pairs are remembered** &mdash; re-run, swap, or pin a pair straight from the Files tab. The environment banner names the active `.red`, and view state round-trips so the tab comes back the way you left it.

### Data pad &mdash; master/detail and field drag-and-drop

Variable rows and the table tree both gain master/detail: type-icon slide-down panels for variables, and table/key/column/relation panels for the tree, with an icon-only header toolbar. Column detail now comes from the **live dictionary** in full, including auto-number and exclude chips on keys. Fields can be **dragged from the pad into an editor** &mdash; Monaco surfaces and legacy ICSharpCode editors both accept a point-drop, with visible drop feedback while you drag.

### Zero-reload error navigation

Clicking a row in the IDE's Errors pane used to close and reopen the embeditor. Navigation is now intercepted and dispatched into the **live overlay**, repositioning it in place &mdash; and unsaved overlay edits survive Clarion's own embed re-open via a mirror/stash/restore path.

### Horizontal split panes (#157)

The editor **Split** button gains an orientation choice: right-click it for **Vertical split (side by side)** or **Horizontal split (top / bottom)**. Choosing an orientation while already split repositions the panes in place &mdash; content, scroll position, and cursor are all preserved; choosing one while unsplit opens the split immediately in that orientation. The choice persists across sessions. The divider now tracks the true midpoint of the editing area, so toggling the Outline or Find-All column while split no longer opens a gap.

### Sort the Document Structure outline (#153)

A new sort toggle in the outline toolbar orders symbols **A&ndash;Z independently at each level** &mdash; a class's methods reorder among themselves while the hierarchy stays intact and siblings never migrate between levels. Toggle it off for document order. Works alongside the existing filter.

### Split a selection into multiple snippet parameters (#154)

Code Snippets gain `${SELECTED:N}` &mdash; the Nth comma-separated part of the current selection (1-based, trimmed), alongside the existing `${SELECTED}` (whole selection). Select `Clientes,CLI:CLI01` and a snippet body like `Access:${SELECTED:1}.Fetch(${SELECTED:2})` expands to `Access:Clientes.Fetch(CLI:CLI01)`. With nothing selected, each distinct `${SELECTED:N}` becomes its own fillable tab-stop instead of a blank hole &mdash; same as `${SELECTED}` already did. See the examples panel (the **?** next to the snippet Body field) for a worked example.

### Field-equate completion on `?` (#159/#160)

Typing `?` now triggers completion directly, and field equates come back as a Reference kind with their own icon. Bare-prefix globals are no longer merged into that list &mdash; previously a variable like `LDField` could prefix-match and outrank the `?LdapButton` you were actually reaching for.

### Contract all / Expand all (#147)

A fold button joins the embeditor toolbar. Click contracts every structure, click again expands, and the icon shows which the next click will do; right-click offers both explicitly. The state is read from the live folding model each time rather than remembered, so folding a region by hand from the gutter can't leave the icon promising the wrong action. Expand is offered only once *everything* foldable is collapsed, so a single hand-folded region doesn't hijack the primary action.

### Code suggestions quote the code (#69)

The assistant now quotes the surrounding lines when it points you at a change, instead of citing a bare line number. This matters most in template-generated `.clw` files: they're regenerated, so a line number goes stale the moment the template runs again, while the surrounding code stays recognizable. A useful side effect &mdash; because locating a change now means reading the real generated source, the assistant can also tell you which **embed** the change belongs in.

### Native embeditor parity and editor options

Long-standing parity gaps close together. **Ctrl+Q** mimics the native embeditor's save-and-exit gesture (#137) &mdash; a dirty buffer raises a confirm where Enter saves and exits, absorbing the trailing Enter of the native muscle memory. The as-you-type aids are now **individually switchable** in the gear panel (#138): *Auto-space assignments (=)* and *Live keyword casing* can each be turned off. `OMIT('term')` and `COMPILE('term')` blocks fold (#133), shared across the embeditor, diff editor, and sticky scroll. Indentation follows **Options &rarr; Text Editor &rarr; Behavior** &mdash; Indentation size, Tab size, and Convert Tabs to Spaces &mdash; instead of assuming 4, via a "Follow Clarion's editor options" checkbox that's on by default (#126).

### CA Editor reliability

The editor watches its file on disk for external read-only and content changes (#146), saves dirty tabs **before a build starts** (#134), and the **Reload** button now actually works (#135) &mdash; it was a no-op since day one &mdash; restoring caret and scroll position when it does. A new `get_diff_content` MCP tool shares a common unified-diff generator with the diff viewer (#131), and the live Monaco cursor is exposed over a cross-addin reflection contract (#149) for consumers like the CA Debugger.

### CodeGraph &mdash; overloaded and shadowed names attribute to the right procedure (#165)

"What does this procedure call?" collapsed every same-named procedure onto one arbitrary winner. `ResolveRelationships` tracked which procedure a line sat inside using dictionaries keyed by **name only**, which can hold one id per name &mdash; so all of these folded together: genuine parameter-type overloads (`Dispatch(LONG)` vs `Dispatch(*CSTRING)`), case variants (`Setup` alongside `SetUp`), and a local **ROUTINE sharing its enclosing PROCEDURE's name**. Every call and reference from any of them was credited to whichever loaded last. In one production module, an entire procedure body was attributed to a routine defined 50 lines *below* the code in question. Resolution is now keyed on each procedure's own definition line, which is unique per file, and the current procedure's name is tracked alongside its id instead of being recovered by reverse-scanning a name-keyed dictionary.

Measured across a 1,659-file production solution: **no call sites lost**, 19,774 gained (`calls` rows up 59%, from 33,319 to 53,093), and **6,240 procedures that never appeared as a caller at all** now do. Symbol counts are byte-identical before and after &mdash; symbol capture was never the broken part. Removing four O(symbols) reverse-scans from the per-line loop also cut full-index time on that solution by roughly **40%** (29.5 min &rarr; 17.6 min).

> **Re-index your solutions after upgrading.** This changes what the indexer *writes*, so every existing `.codegraph.db` still holds the old attribution and will keep returning the pre-fix answers until it's rebuilt. Use **Reindex** (full rebuild) &mdash; **Update** is not enough: the incremental path compares source timestamps, and since your code hasn't changed it reports "0 of N projects have changes" and skips the work. Same story for the MCP `index_codegraph` tool: pass a full index, not incremental. Library graphs under `%APPDATA%\ClarionAssistant\clariongraph\` want the same treatment via **Build Library**.

### Hover placement, size, and clickable locations (#164)

Hovers render **below** the hovered line instead of above it, nudged clear of the label column &mdash; Monaco's default put the tooltip squarely on top of the lines you were just reading, which in Clarion is the column-0 label area. The widget also renders one pixel under the editor font rather than inheriting it outright, tracking both the gear panel's font size and Ctrl+wheel zoom. Location footers in a hover (`Foo.inc:12 → Foo.clw:340`) become clickable and navigate the IDE, replacing a default handler that treated them as external links. The click path is live now but stays quiet until the companion language-server change ships &mdash; nothing emits those links yet.

### Fixed

- **Hover inside a string or comment showed an unrelated symbol** (#166) &mdash; hovering the `'Total'` argument in `SomeClass.SetValue('Total', 2, ...)` surfaced the info for a local variable named `Total` declared elsewhere in the procedure. The language server was right to return nothing; that empty answer is exactly what triggered CodeGraph's hover fallback, which matched identifier-shaped text with a plain regex and no idea it sat inside quotes. The fallback now bails on strings and `!` comments the same way the server already did &mdash; `''` treated as an escaped quote, both delimiting quotes counted as inside.
- **Output pane deafness** (#140) &mdash; while a Monaco editor was the active document, the IDE's Output pane (Build / Generator / Debug) couldn't be clicked into, drag-selected, or Ctrl+A'd; only scroll worked. Monaco no longer steals focus from IDE pads, with no regression to editor-focus-on-tab-switch.
- **Hover and completion respect procedure scope** (#152) &mdash; a local, routine, or module variable declared in the current buffer now outranks a same-named symbol anywhere else in the solution or library, and a not-yet-indexed local procedure resolves from the buffer. A column-1 declaration in progress no longer leaks the *previous* procedure's locals into the completion list, and an exact-match identifier outranks a keyword that merely prefixes it (typing `PRO` where a local `PRO` exists no longer commits `PROCEDURE`).
- **Phantom "END has no matching structure" warnings** (#156) &mdash; bare screen `GROUP` controls in a WINDOW and anonymous `RECORD, PRE()` structures inside a FILE no longer desync the embed slot's structure-balance checker, while a plain variable named `Group` or `Record` still correctly produces no warning. Shipped with a repro fixture that must yield zero diagnostics.
- **Cold-open navigation lands on the right line** (#162) &mdash; Errors-pane clicks, bookmarks, and Find Next targeting a file that isn't open yet could silently drop the requested line and open wherever the file was last positioned. The requested position is now parked before the file opens, closing the race for every caller that drives the hidden caret directly.
- **Duplicate entries in member completion** (#151) &mdash; dedupe now keys on each item's bare identifier rather than its display label, so a member the language server already resolved can't be re-added under its bare name.
- **More keyword-as-label misreads** (#132/#136/#150) &mdash; `MENU`, `MENUBAR`, `SHEET`, `TAB`, `OPTION`, and `TOOLBAR` used as plain variable names no longer read as structure openers, and the label check is now strict column 0, matching the real compiler rule.
- **Cross-instance WebView2 crashes** (#141) &mdash; each Clarion process gets an isolated WebView2 profile, allocated from stable slots rather than per-PID folders.
- **Errors-pane caret mirroring** (#144) &mdash; native caret jumps are mirrored into the Monaco overlay, so an error click lands where it should.
- **Unsaved edits preserved** &mdash; overlay edits survive Clarion's embed re-open, and a disk-watched file turning read-only no longer discards them.
- **Go-to-definition no longer jumps to itself** (#143) &mdash; the fallback path could resolve a symbol to the very line you invoked it from.
- **Dead overlay Find-All results-tools row removed** (#116/#145) &mdash; Copy / Clear were wired but could never render.
- **Fold triangles on ordinary statement lines** (#158) &mdash; the folding scanner matched structure keywords inside string literals, so `MESSAGE('Unable to initialize Session Class instance')` or a `'Content-Type: application/xml'` header opened a phantom fold that swallowed the enclosing structure. One production 9,000-line file contained 64 such literals. String contents are now blanked before the keyword scan &mdash; which also makes comment-stripping literal-aware, so a `!` inside a string no longer truncates the line. Fixes the CA Embeditor, both diff panes and sticky-scroll headers at once.
- **CA Find opened dark regardless of your theme** (#148) &mdash; the pad only restored a theme it had saved itself, falling back to dark otherwise. It now seeds from Clarion Assistant's own light/dark setting, while a preference set inside the pad still wins.
- **CA Find** no longer misses keyboard focus on the first Ctrl+F after IDE start (#139).
- **CA Explorer polish** &mdash; dark-mode secondary text lifted above the WCAG AA contrast floor; dropdown menus kept inside the WebView2; tooltips flipped above the native drop strip; the last row's path line no longer clipped; the Files tab stops jumping on every activation.

### Known issues

- **Check the install folder if you have two installs of the same Clarion version** (#142). The installer derives each Clarion root from the registry (`HKLM\SOFTWARE\SoftVelocity\Clarion<version>\root`) on every run, and does **not** remember a folder you picked by hand last time. If the registry points at one Clarion 11 install and you actually launch a different one, setup will default to the registry's copy and quietly install where you don't run it &mdash; and the symptom is confusing, because the IDE then loads an older addin and behaves like the bugs you just upgraded to fix. Verify the path on the install page, and if you correct it, expect to correct it again next time. If you're unsure which build you're actually running, the CA panel reports the version of the DLL Clarion loaded &mdash; if that doesn't match the release you installed, this is why. A proper fix (remembering your choice) is queued for the next cycle.

### Thanks

- **geircodes** &mdash; the bulk of this cycle: horizontal split panes (#157), outline sort (#153), field-equate completion (#159/#160), scoping fixes (#152), GROUP/RECORD and keyword-as-label diagnostics (#132, #136, #150, #156), cold-open navigation (#162), completion dedupe (#151), CA Editor reliability (#134, #135, #146), WebView2 profile isolation (#141), CA Find focus (#139), Errors-pane caret mirroring (#144), go-to-definition self-jump (#143), `get_diff_content` (#131), and the cross-addin cursor contract (#149).

- **Adrián Santarelli** &mdash; snippet parameter splitting (#155).
- **BoxSoft** &mdash; Ctrl+Q parity (#137), the as-you-type opt-outs (#138), and the case for quoting code over line numbers (#69).
- **armisoftware** &mdash; OMIT/COMPILE folding (#133), Contract all / Expand all (#147), and the Find pad's theme (#148).
- **geircodes** also root-caused the phantom fold triangles (#158), including the measurement &mdash; 64 colliding string literals in a single 9,000-line file &mdash; that showed it was systemic rather than a two-line curiosity; and closed out the cycle with the CodeGraph overload-attribution fix (#165), the string/comment hover guard (#166), and the hover placement work (#164). The overload fix shipped with a compiling repro fixture and its own regression SQL, and quantified the damage first: 4,372 relationship rows collapsed onto one overload per name, with 79 of 145 overload symbols completely invisible as callers.

## What's New in v5.4

v5.4 is the biggest community cycle yet. Full notes: [docs/releases/v5.4.0.md](v5.4.0.md).

### CA Find & Replace suite (#66)
Find & Replace becomes a first-class subsystem: a dockable **CA Find pad** (the default for Ctrl+F/Ctrl+H), an optional classic **in-editor overlay** (Options &rarr; Clarion Assistant &rarr; Find / Replace), a **Find-All** column whose results can open in their own editor tab with context, click-through, and filtering (#113/#114), and **one shared find/replace history** across every CA surface with a per-procedure recent group.

### Document Structure outline
A fly-out outline of the current buffer &mdash; procedures, routines, classes and data with VS Code's symbol icons, Class &#9656; Methods regrouping, filtering, and expand/collapse-all. Click to jump; Navigate Back returns you.

### Parameter hints, Ctrl+F12, real-scope embeds
Signature help while typing a call (#75) and go-to-implementation (#78) in both Monaco surfaces. The embed buffer is now presented to the language server as a real MEMBER module of your PROGRAM, so completion/hover/F12 inside embeds see your global data (#74). `:` triggers completion like `.` (#52).

### Dictionary- and CodeGraph-aware completion in the CA Embeditor
Completion reaches into your ingested **SchemaGraph** (dictionary tables/fields/keys) and **CodeGraph** (solution-wide symbols) databases (#99): `PRE:` prefixes suggest that table's columns and keys with declared types and descriptions; bare prefixes suggest dictionary table names; variable completions show real declared types and scope. Requires a SchemaGraph source indexed once via Solution Settings &rarr; Schema Sources.

### Navigation history that keeps its promises
Back/Forward reliably return to the position the editor opened at, outline jump targets, go-to-definition origins, and host-driven jumps &mdash; explicit targets are pinned so a follow-up click can't erase them.

### Dark mode & accessibility
No white flash opening the embeditor in dark mode; contrast-guarded toolbar text on dark IDE chrome; Monaco's High Contrast toggle persists across sessions with visibly shaded read-only sections; CA Explorer tooltips drawn in-page (fixes a stuck-tooltip bug, #108).

### CodeGraph accuracy campaign
~20 indexer fixes driven by real production code (#79&ndash;#93, #97, #112, #118): INCLUDE discovery, typed PROCEDURE parameters, cross-file and inherited member call resolution, every GROUP/QUEUE/CLASS declaration spelling, built-in name collisions &mdash; with the repro solution vendored as a regression fixture.

### Clarion 11.1, VS2026, portable installs (#91)
Clarion **11.1** is a distinct build/deploy/install target; the build supports VS2026 Build Tools; installer paths are portable.

### Diff, terminal & reliability
Live-buffer diffs with encoding detection (#94), a current-line comparison panel (#96), clipboard-image paste as @-reference (#95); embeditor tab-switch no longer reloads/loses edits (#76), WebView2 crash process reaping (#109/#120), bundled LSP re-pinned to Clarion-Extension v1.0.0 (#77 &mdash; the per-configuration redirection fix), server re-root on solution switch (#106).

### Thanks
Community contributions from **Mark Sarson**, **geircodes**, **Adrián Santarelli**, **OkayPlunk**, plus reports from **BoxSoft** and **Bill Atchison**.

## What's New in v5.3

v5.3 is a refinement release &mdash; it sharpens the Monaco editor, Smart Formatter, and completion that landed in v5.1/v5.2, adds editor personalization and one-click surface toggles, and folds in a round of community fixes.

### Editor & Embeditor toggles on the IDE toolbar

Two new buttons on the main Clarion IDE toolbar let you flip the **CA Editor** and **CA Embeditor** overlays on or off without opening Settings &mdash; handy when you want to drop back to the native editor for a moment.

### Editor personalization

The gear panel gains two long-requested settings:

- **Font family** &mdash; pick the typeface for the Monaco source editor and CA Embeditor.
- **Occurrence highlighting** &mdash; toggle the highlight of other instances of the symbol under the cursor.

### Richer completion

Bare-prefix completion now also surfaces **module-level data** (variables declared outside any procedure) and **module-local procedures** (declared in the module MAP or as in-buffer sibling implementations), each with type/signature detail &mdash; on top of the globals, classes, and procedure locals added in v5.1.

### Smart Formatter & editor fixes

- **Built-in functions in call position** are cased correctly by **Ctrl+I** and as you type.
- **Keyword-named data labels** (e.g. a variable named like a statement) no longer open a phantom structure during formatting.
- **MAP formatting** and keyword-first completion behave correctly.
- **Case commands with no selection** now act on the character at the cursor.
- **Find matches track live buffer edits** &mdash; F3 and replace land at the correct positions after you've edited the buffer.
- **Commit-on-insert-key** works for keyword completions, with `{` added as a commit key.
- **CA Embeditor overlay** navigates to the native caret position when it attaches, so you start where you left off.

### Reliability

- **MCP HTTP listener** no longer deadlocks when the IDE UI thread is busy.
- **Windows PowerShell 5.1** can parse the bundled scripts (UTF-8 BOM), and the indexer's SQLite reference is fixed.

### Thanks

Community contributions in this release from **Adrián Santarelli** (#71), **Mark Sarson** (#68), **bdinko** (#59), and **Aarhusdk** (#57).

## What's New in v5.2

v5.2 makes the CA Embeditor feel completely native: it now rides Clarion's **own** "Embeditor Source" command instead of a separate menu item, and it appears with no flicker.

### CA Embeditor rides Clarion's native "Embeditor Source"

There is no longer a separate **Open in CA Embeditor** popup item. Just open an embed the way you always have &mdash; right-click a procedure &rarr; **Embeditor Source**, or the **Embeditor** button on the Views toolbar &mdash; and the Monaco CA Embeditor overlays the native embeditor automatically. One embed at a time, exactly like the native editor; edits save straight back with **Save &amp; Exit** (no re-open).

- **Nothing new to learn** &mdash; the trigger is Clarion's existing command, so it works from every place that opens an embed.
- **Toggle** the overlay under **Options &rarr; Clarion Assistant &rarr; Editor Surfaces** (&ldquo;Use the Monaco embeditor&rdquo;, on by default).
- **Flicker-free** &mdash; the overlay is placed the instant the embed view opens, before the native editor paints, so you don't see the native embeditor flash first.

*(Thanks to Mark Sarson &mdash; this adopts the auto-detect approach from his [ClarionMonacoEditor](https://github.com/msarson/ClarionMonacoEditor).)*

### Code Snippets in the editor

A full snippet workflow lands in the Monaco source editor and CA Embeditor:

- **Snippet picker** &mdash; theme-aware, with a **live expansion preview** so you see the resulting code (tab-stops visible) before inserting.
- **Snippets in completion** &mdash; type a trigger and press **Enter** to expand (Clarion Ctrl+J parity), or use **trigger + space** for Clarion-style expansion.
- **Manage them in the gear panel** &mdash; edit snippets with examples/help, tab-stop mirroring, and case-insensitive extension scoping.

### Pure upstream language server (v0.9.8)

The bundled LSP is now **stock upstream** [msarson/Clarion-Extension](https://github.com/msarson/Clarion-Extension) **v0.9.8** &mdash; CodeGraph intelligence runs entirely on the CA (C#) side, so there is no patched server to drift out of date, and future upstream releases are a clean one-step re-pin.

### Removed

- The old **Open in CA Embeditor** right-click menu injection and its underlying native Windows-hook machinery have been retired &mdash; the native-command overlay replaces them entirely, with far less moving machinery in the IDE.

---

## What's New in v5.1

v5.1 brings a modern editing experience to the Clarion IDE: Monaco is now the default source editor, a Smart Formatter cleans up your code on demand, and the CA Embeditor and CA Explorer give you a fast, keyboard-friendly way to work with embeds and their data.

### Monaco is now the default Clarion source editor

Clarion source files (`.clw`, `.inc`) open by default in a Monaco-powered editor &mdash; syntax highlighting, code folding, **F12 / Ctrl+Click go-to-definition**, inline diagnostics, and completion &mdash; while keeping the same save and navigation behavior as the native editor.

- **Toggleable per surface** &mdash; turn the Monaco source editor or the Monaco embeditor off under **Options &rarr; Clarion Assistant &rarr; Editor Surfaces**, with an optional file-type filter. Changes apply the next time you open a file.

### Smart Formatter (Ctrl+I)

Press **Ctrl+I** in the Monaco source editor or CA Embeditor to reformat Clarion code &mdash; consistent indentation for structures (IF/LOOP/CASE/ACCEPT) and aligned data declarations. As-you-type aids apply light formatting while you write, and the formatter's behavior is configurable.

### Embed navigation (Ctrl+J / Ctrl+B)

The native Clarion embeditor walks the *filled* embed points with **Ctrl+J** (next) and **Ctrl+B** (previous), and the CA Embeditor now answers the same keys (#185, thanks to BoxSoft). Navigation wraps at either end and acts on whichever split pane has focus. The toolbar's filled-embed arrows do the same thing, and the unfiltered walk over *every* embed &mdash; filled or not &mdash; is available as **Next/Previous Embed (any)** in the gear panel's Keyboard section, unbound by default. In a plain source file there are no embeds, so the keys report that rather than moving the caret.

### Code Snippets (Ctrl+Shift+J)

Press **Ctrl+Shift+J** in the CA Embeditor to open a code-snippet picker &mdash; the classic Clarion text editor puts its template picker on Ctrl+J, but the Clarion *embeditor* uses Ctrl+J to jump to the next filled embed (#185), so the picker takes Ctrl+Shift+J and Ctrl+J is left to mean what it means natively. Both are rebindable in the gear panel's Keyboard section, so you can swap them back if you prefer. The picker is filterable by trigger/description and scoped to the active file's extension.

- **Managed from Settings &rarr; Snippets** &mdash; add/edit/delete snippets (trigger, description, extensions, body); stored globally in `%APPDATA%\ClarionAssistant\snippets.json`.
- **Tab-stops** &mdash; bodies use VS Code-style snippet syntax (`$1`, `${1:default}`, `$0`); **Tab**/**Shift+Tab** cycles between stops after insertion.
- **`${SELECTED}`** &mdash; substituted with the text selected when the picker was opened, or left as a fillable tab-stop if nothing was selected.
- **Auto-indent** &mdash; continuation lines match the indentation of the line the picker was triggered on.

### CA Embeditor &mdash; right-click a procedure to open it instantly

Opening a procedure's embed code is a single right-click. In the Clarion application tree, right-click any procedure and choose **Open in CA Embeditor** &mdash; the procedure opens directly in a fast Monaco/WebView2 editor, with no Tools-menu or picker round-trip.

- **One-click from the app tree** &mdash; right-click the procedure &rarr; **Open in CA Embeditor**. The procedure you clicked is the one that opens.
- **Multiple procedures as tabs** &mdash; open several procedures side by side; each gets its own CA Embeditor tab.
- **Also available from the toolbar** &mdash; the **CA Embeditor** button on the native embed-editor toolbar opens the currently selected procedure.

### CA Explorer

A docked pad that shows the data behind the procedure you're editing. Open it from **Tools &rarr; CA Explorer** or with **Ctrl+Alt+D** (its docked title bar reads **CA Explorer**); it follows the active CA Embeditor tab.

- **Local, Module &amp; Global Data** &mdash; the variables in scope for the active procedure.
- **Declared Tables &amp; Other Files** &mdash; with their **Keys**, **Columns**, and **Relations**.
- **Follows the active tab** &mdash; switch CA Embeditor tabs and the pad updates to match.
- **Drag a field to the editor or designer** &mdash; drop a column or variable onto the Monaco editor or the native Window designer to create a bound control.
- **Copy / paste variables** native-style, plus a **Cheat Sheet tab** of Monaco editor shortcuts.

### Richer LSP in the Monaco surfaces

The Monaco source editor and CA Embeditor surface live error/warning squiggles and code completion directly as you type &mdash; including `PROP:`/`EVENT:` equates and member-access (`oInstance.Method`) suggestions &mdash; alongside F12 / Ctrl+Click go-to-definition.

### Fixed

- **Clean-install editor load on Clarion 12** &mdash; a strong-name assembly version-lock caused a `Cannot create object: MonacoClarionEditorDisplayBinding` error on C12 builds other than the dev build. The editor now loads on any Clarion 12 build, and installer packaging (Monaco assets and LSP contracts) has been corrected.

### Renamed: "Modern Embeditor / Modern Data" &rarr; "CA Embeditor / CA Explorer"

The feature previously shown as *Modern Embeditor* and *Modern Data* is now **CA Embeditor** and **CA Explorer** (Clarion Assistant) across the menus and UI. Same feature, clearer name.

---

## What's New in v4.6

### Custom MCP servers in the IDE pane (issue #26)

Users can now expose their own MCP servers to the in-IDE Claude tabs without modifying the addin, alongside the three built-ins (clarion-assistant, project-hub, browser).

- **`%APPDATA%\ClarionAssistant\mcp-extra.json` sidecar** &mdash; standard `mcpServers` JSON. Entries are merged into the generated mcp-config.json each time a Claude tab launches, so edits take effect on the *next* tab spawn without restarting the IDE.
- **Settings &rarr; MCP page** has a new "Custom MCP Servers in the IDE Pane" section with an **Open** button that creates the file from a commented template if missing, then shell-opens it. Always visible regardless of the External Access toggle.
- **Auto-approve** &mdash; `mcp__<server>__*` is appended to `--allowedTools` for every sidecar entry, so user tools don't trigger permission prompts inside the IDE pane.
- **Reserved-key protection** &mdash; an mcp-extra.json entry that collides with a built-in key (`clarion-assistant`, `project-hub`, `browser`) is silently skipped; the addin's real entry always wins.
- **Malformed-JSON resilience** &mdash; a corrupted sidecar (trailing comma, stray brace, etc.) is logged and ignored. The tab still launches with the three built-ins.
- **Empty-state safe** &mdash; if the file doesn't exist, behavior is identical to v4.5: just the three built-ins, no errors.

Smoke-tested end-to-end with `@modelcontextprotocol/server-everything` against all four corners: happy path, collision, malformed JSON, missing file.

### Codex config self-heal

Fixes a corruption mode where launching a Codex tab would error with `duplicate key [mcp_servers.clarion-assistant]` and refuse to start.

Codex CLI's TOML serializer silently drops trailing comments when it appends state tables (e.g. `[tui.model_availability_nux]`), which removed our `<<< end >>>` marker. The next CA launch then saw a begin marker with no matching end and appended a second managed block, producing duplicate `[mcp_servers.clarion-assistant]` tables.

- **Self-healing rewrite** &mdash; on every Codex launch CA now strips all CA markers (paired or orphan) and all `[mcp_servers.clarion-assistant.*]` sections anywhere in the file, lifts foreign tables out of any broken managed region, and appends one fresh canonical block. Even a config that's already broken (two begin markers, one end, duplicate tables) is cleaned up automatically on the next launch.
- **No user action required** &mdash; just relaunch a Codex tab and the file is repaired in place.

---

## What's New in v4.5

### External MCP client access (issue #24)

Lets external tools (Claude Desktop, Cline, custom mcp-remote setups) authenticate against ClarionAssistant's local MCP server using a stable user-managed token instead of the per-session token that rotates each IDE start.

- **New "MCP Server" Settings page** with a "Most users can skip this page" intro &mdash; the toggle is opt-in for users who want CA's IDE tools surfaced in tools outside the IDE.
- **Allow external MCP clients toggle** persists across IDE restarts. Off by default.
- **Generate button** mints a 64-character hex bearer token, stored in `settings.txt`. Idempotent: regenerating invalidates any external configs already using the previous token.
- **Live endpoint URL** display shows `http://localhost:<port>/mcp` (port is dynamically chosen at startup).
- **Pre-filled `mcp-remote` config snippet** with **Copy config** button &mdash; ready to paste into the external tool's MCP config.
- **Add to Claude Desktop button** &mdash; one-click integration: writes the `clarion-assistant` entry directly into `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`, backs up the original to `.clarionassistant.bak`, atomic write. Idempotent (re-click after rotating token to push the update).
- **Dual-token authentication in `RequireAuth`** &mdash; the per-session token still authenticates in-IDE Claude Code / Copilot / Codex tabs; the static external token is checked additionally when external access is enabled. Both compared in constant time. Settings re-read on every request so toggle/rotation takes effect immediately.

### SettingsService cross-process hardening (collateral)

Strengthening the settings store to support the External MCP feature surfaced multiple latent issues that affect every settings save, not just MCP tokens:

- **Static lock + named mutex** (`Local\ClarionAssistant.SettingsService.v1`) serializes settings writes across all SettingsService instances within a process AND across multiple ClarionAssistant processes (the addin supports multi-IDE).
- **Reload-before-write merge** &mdash; rotating Mcp.ExternalToken in one place no longer gets reverted when an unrelated control later saves an unrelated setting.
- **Atomic file replace** via temp-file + `File.Replace` (ReplaceFileW on NTFS) so concurrent readers always see either the old file or the new file, never a half-written one.
- **Reload preserves in-memory state** when the file is missing or the read fails &mdash; transient delete-then-rename from sync tools / antivirus no longer wipes settings on the next save.
- **`SettingsLockedException`** is thrown when another CA process holds the cross-process mutex past the 5s budget; the settings dialog catches it and surfaces an actionable message instead of silently degrading.

### Pre-existing security hardening still applies

The MCP server still binds to loopback only (Windows OS blocks remote connections), validates Host and Origin headers (DNS-rebinding and browser-drive-by defense), and uses constant-time token comparison.

---

## What's New in v4.4

### OpenAI Codex CLI backend

Codex joins Claude Code and Copilot as a third launchable terminal backend.

- **Backend selection on the dashboard** &mdash; Codex is now a third option alongside Claude Code and Copilot. Tab labels show **CC** (Claude Code) / **CP** (Copilot) / **CO** (Codex).
- **MCP wiring via `mcp-remote` stdio bridge** &mdash; Codex CLI's native HTTP/SSE transport timed out against CA's Streamable-HTTP `/mcp` endpoint, so CA writes a marker-delimited block in `~/.codex/config.toml` that bridges through `mcp-remote`. Foreign tables Codex CLI itself appends inside the markers (e.g. `[tui.model_availability_nux]`) are lifted out and preserved on rewrite.
- **Pinned `mcp-remote` install** &mdash; CA refuses to write the Codex MCP config if `mcp-remote` isn't installed at the expected npm-global location, and refuses to wire it if the installed version doesn't match the pinned version. Closes a supply-chain risk where `npx -y mcp-remote` would auto-fetch from the public registry at launch with the live MCP bearer token.
- **Codex settings panel** &mdash; reasoning effort dropdown (Auto / low / medium / high), one-time install instruction for `mcp-remote`. Models populated from Codex CLI's actual `/models` list: GPT-5.5 (default), GPT-5.4, GPT-5.4 mini, GPT-5.3 Codex, GPT-5.2.
- **AGENTS.md preserved** &mdash; CA only writes the briefing file when one doesn't already exist in the working directory. Won't clobber a repo-tracked `AGENTS.md`.
- **Robust exception handling in the launch banner** &mdash; failure-reason text is sanitized (CR/LF, double quotes, single quotes, truncated to 240 chars) before splicing into the PowerShell `Write-Host` payload.

### Bundled installer ships with Codex support
Settings → MCP Server panel and the new sidebar entry are part of the standard install.

## What's New in v4.3

### Backend selection UX
- **Dashboard backend dropdown** &mdash; pick Claude Code or Copilot per click; overrides the saved default without rewriting it. "Reset to default" link appears whenever the dropdown differs from the saved default.
- **Per-card backend badges** on the quick-action cards (CLAUDE CODE / COPILOT) update live with the dropdown so you can see at a glance which backend each click will launch.
- **Tab-strip labels show the backend** &mdash; new tabs read "Terminal 1 CC" (Claude Code), "Terminal 2 CP" (Copilot), or "CO" (Codex placeholder, reserved for future). Custom-named tabs get the same suffix: "MyProject CC".

### Settings dialog redesign
- **Launch page is now first in the sidebar** and uses per-backend tabs (Launch / Models) under a dropdown
- **"Set as Default" button** replaces the implicit "saved when you change the dropdown" behavior &mdash; now you can inspect any backend's settings without accidentally changing the default
- **Working Directory and Projects Directory are per-backend** &mdash; live on the Models tab; each backend remembers its own paths
- **General page removed** &mdash; its global fields moved: Working Directory to Launch (Models tab, per backend), COM Projects Folder to Classes

### Unified assistant instructions
- **Copilot sessions now get the full 220-line Clarion IDE prompt** previously only Claude received. Both backends share a single authoritative `clarion-assistant-prompt.md`, deployed as `AGENTS.md` for Copilot.

### Security hardening
- **MCP HTTP server requires a per-session bearer token** &mdash; generated fresh each addin start and embedded in the MCP config file each CLI client reads. Drive-by browser fetches to `localhost:19372` no longer reach the tools surface.
- **CORS permissiveness removed** &mdash; `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *` is gone; browser drive-by can't read responses.
- **Host and Origin header validation** blocks DNS-rebinding attacks and cross-origin browser requests.
- **pwsh launch payload now tokenizes and quotes user settings** &mdash; `Copilot.ExtraFlags`, Claude/Copilot command entries, and Copilot.Model go through a new `PwshCommandQuoter` helper. A crafted settings value can no longer chain arbitrary PowerShell commands.
- **Settings file newline rejection** &mdash; `SettingsService.Set` now throws on CR/LF in values (previously a `\n` could smuggle a second key on reload, e.g. stealth-enabling `Copilot.PermissionMode=allow`).

### Reliability
- **DocGraph FTS5 load fixed** &mdash; `query_docs` no longer intermittently returns "database disk image is malformed" on valid data. The extension is now loaded from an absolute path (no more `LoadLibrary` search-order roulette), and a smoke probe at first use surfaces a clear diagnostic error if the FTS5 module fails to register.
- **New `rebuild_docgraph_fts` MCP tool** &mdash; in-place recovery if someone lands on a corrupted FTS shadow index. Drops and recreates the FTS table from the intact `doc_chunks` content.

### Internals (visible in debug logs)
- **Renamed `ClaudeChatControl` &rarr; `AssistantChatControl`** to reflect its dual-backend role
- **Shared launch scaffolding** &mdash; `LaunchClaudeForTab` and `LaunchCopilotForTab` now share `PrepareBackendLaunch`, `StartTabTerminal`, `AbortLaunch` helpers so adding a 3rd backend (Codex etc.) is a matter of writing one command-body builder, not re-copying ~60 lines of scaffolding

## What's New in v4.2

### GitHub Copilot CLI Backend
- **New Assistant Backend setting** (Settings → Launch) — switch between Claude Code and GitHub Copilot CLI per terminal session
- **Copilot Commands** — configurable launch commands for Copilot (same Add/Edit/Delete/Set Default UI as Claude commands), with defaults: `copilot`, `gh copilot`, `copilot --allow-all-tools`
- **Copilot Model selector** (Settings → General) — dropdown with all available Copilot models grouped by provider (GPT-5.x, Claude 4.x); model is passed via `--model` flag at launch
- **Permission Mode** — choose between `Prompt` (default) or `Allow Tools` (`--allow-all-tools`)
- **Extra Flags** — optional additional flags appended to the Copilot command
- **MCP integration** — Clarion Assistant MCP server auto-configured for Copilot with `tools: ["*"]` format; custom instructions deployed via `COPILOT_CUSTOM_INSTRUCTIONS_DIRS`
- **Per-tab backend tracking** — each tab remembers its backend (`AssistantBackend` property) so status bar and exit handling work correctly even if the setting changes mid-session

### Build improvements
- Explicit WebView2 assembly references in `.csproj` to fix compile-time resolution under MSBuild
- `ValidateClarionReferences` MSBuild target for clearer error messages when `ClarionRoot` is not set
